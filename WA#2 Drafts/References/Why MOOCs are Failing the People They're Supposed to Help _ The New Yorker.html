data-template="two-column" class="ArticleBody__articleBody___1GSGP"><div><div><p>On July 23rd, 1969, Geoffrey Crowther <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.col.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/Daniel_CROWTHER_Speech_1969.pdf" target="_blank">addressed</a> the inaugural meeting of the Open University, a British institution that had just been created to provide an alternative to traditional higher education. Courses would be conducted by mail and live radio. The basic mission, Crowther declared, was a simple one: to be open to people from all walks of life. “The first, and most urgent task before us is to cater for the many thousands of people, fully capable of a higher education, who, for one reason or another, do not get it, or do not get as much of it as they can turn to advantage, or as they discover, sometimes too late, that they need,” he told his audience. “Men and women drop out through failures in the system,” he continued, “through disadvantages of their environment, through mistakes of their own judgment, through sheer bad luck. These are our primary material.” He then invoked the message emblazoned on the Statue of Liberty: Open University wanted the tired, the poor, the huddled masses. To them, most of all, it opened its doors.</p><p>The mission Crowther described is the same one that has driven the proliferation of massive open online courses, or <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/20/laptop-u"><em class="small">MOOC</em>s</a>, during the past few years. (Open University has often <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://linc.mit.edu/linc2013/proceedings/LINC-2013-Proceedings.pdf" target="_blank">served</a> as a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/05/features/university-just-got-flipped" target="_blank">sort</a> of inspirational <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://davecormier.com/edblog/2013/04/12/what-do-you-mean-open/" target="_blank">model</a> for <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://sirjohn.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/130614PennState.pdf" target="_blank">such</a> <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/videoAndAudio/channels/publicLecturesAndEvents/player.aspx?id=1859" target="_blank">ventures</a>, which <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/20/laptop-u%20">Nathan Heller wrote about</a> last year in the magazine.) The premise of the <em class="small">MOOC</em> movement is as commendable as it is democratic: quality education should not be a luxury good. <em class="small">MOOC</em>s are flexible and they can be free; if people want an education, <em class="small">MOOC</em>s can give it to them.</p><p><em class="small">MOOC</em>s started with a bang of optimism. In 2011, Sebastian Thrun, a star professor at Stanford, made his introductory course on artificial intelligence available via an online broadcast. Within three months, he garnered over a hundred and sixty thousand viewers. Soon after, he started Udacity, one of the largest <em class="small">MOOC</em> platforms. Other platforms that have sprung up in recent years include edX, which was developed through a collaboration between Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Coursera, which was co-founded by two of Thrun’s colleagues at Stanford; and Khan Academy, the brainchild of the former hedge-fund analyst Salman Khan. Overseas, there are ventures like <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://iversity.org/" target="_blank">iversity</a> and <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.futurelearn.com/" target="_blank">FutureLearn</a>. And the number of available classes has been growing at an impressive pace. This month, there are four hundred and ninety-five <em class="small">MOOC</em>s listed as in-progress on the <em class="small">MOOC</em> aggregator <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.class-central.com/" target="_blank">Class Central</a>, five times as many as there were a year ago.</p><p>And yet, despite the steady spread of the <em class="small">MOOC</em> movement and the <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.onlinelearningsurvey.com/reports/changingcourse.pdf" target="_blank">growing acceptance</a> among university administrators that quality online education doesn’t have to be an oxymoron, enthusiasm for <em class="small">MOOC</em>s <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/reputations-at-risk-as-platforms-fail-to-screen-moocs/2014381.article" target="_blank">has</a> <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01587919.2013.876142" target="_blank">waned</a> in the past year. Last winter, Thrun himself expressed some doubts. “We were on the front pages of newspapers and magazines, and at the same time, I was realizing, we don’t educate people as others wished, or as I wished,” he told <em class="">Fast Company</em>_ <em class="">in an <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb" target="_blank">interview</a>. “We have a lousy product.” (He later <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/us/after-setbacks-online-courses-are-rethought.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">told</a> the <em class="">Times</em></em> _that his enthusiasm had not actually declined as much as he might have indicated.)</p><p>On one hand, <em class="small">MOOC</em>s have achieved some worthy goals: they make top educational resources available, for free or for very low prices, to people who wouldn’t have access to them otherwise, including older populations, people with unpredictable schedules, and international audiences. And the quality of the education they offer can be quite high: the Open University, for instance, which began to offer online courses in the nineties, has <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/may/10/universityguide-open-uni" target="_blank">consistently ranked</a> among the top universities in the U.K. in measures of student satisfaction.</p><p>On the other hand, there are the numbers that gave Thrun pause. <em class="small">MOOC</em> enrollment has soared, but completion rates are abysmal. According to a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.gse.upenn.edu/pdf/ahead/perna_ruby_boruch_moocs_dec2013.pdf" target="_blank">2013 study</a>, an average of only five per cent of the students in seventeen Coursera classes offered through the University of Pennsylvania actually finished their classes. Other estimated completion rates hover below thirteen per cent. And not all of the students who completed their courses necessarily passed.</p><p>The problem with <em class="small">MOOC</em>s begins with the fact that, as their name says, they’re massive and open, which means that it can be easy to get lost in them. There are tens or even hundreds of thousands of students in some classes. Often, the students receive no personal acknowledgment or contact to hold them to account. And they can generally drop out the second they’re unhappy, frustrated, or overwhelmed. The <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0158791022000009196" target="_blank">data</a>suggest, in fact, that the students who succeed in the <em class="small">MOOC</em> environment are those who don’t particularly need <em class="small">MOOC</em>s in the first place: they are the self-motivated, self-directed, and independent individuals who would push to succeed anywhere.</p><p><a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2350964" target="_blank">Last year</a>, a team from the University of Pennsylvania, led by Gayle Christensen, found that the majority of the people enrolled in thirty-two of the courses offered through Penn’s Coursera platform were young, already well educated, from developed countries, and, for the most part, employed—precisely the traditional students that Crowther held in contrast to the Open University’s target demographic. And most of the students weren’t taking classes in order to gain an essential education that they wouldn’t receive otherwise; predominantly, they said they had enrolled to satisfy curiosity or advance in a current job—both of which are worthy pursuits, to be sure, but they<span data-page="page_2"></span> are not the main needs that <em class="small">MOOC</em>s were created to meet.</p><p>Earlier this year, an M.I.T. post-doctoral researcher named Jennifer DeBoer <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.educationaldatamining.org/EDM2013/papers/rn_paper_57.pdf" target="_blank">analyzed</a> student data from an M.I.T. class offered through the edX platform to see if there were any factors that predicted success in the class. When she and her colleagues looked at over seven thousand responses to an exit survey, they found that the students who did the best were the ones who came in with prior education, had the highest intellectual starting points, and collaborated outside of class. In other words, those who succeeded in the <em class="small">MOOC</em> were those who had already succeeded academically.</p><p>A <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.sjsu.edu/chemistry/People/Faculty/Collins_Research_Page/AOLE%20Report%20-September%2010%202013%20final.pdf" target="_blank">2013 analysis</a> of an ambitious project launched by San Jose State University in collaboration with Udacity showed similar patterns. The program was the first step of a planned push to incorporate online learning into the California’s public-university system. It was open to would-be college students as well as those who were already enrolled. The analysis found students who had already matriculated performed notably better than those who hadn’t. While overall pass rates were quite low—an average of thirty-three per cent across the three courses in the sample—those who performed the worst were the students who were not already enrolled at the university. In a remedial algebra course, for instance, only a quarter of the students passed, and less than one fifth of the non-matriculated students were among them. To put it in absolute terms, out of eighty-one students in the course, only twenty passed and only six of those were non-matriculated students. As the authors of the report acknowledged, the rates were disappointingly low. The project was suspended for reassessment.</p><p>Even students who succeed in traditional classrooms can get lost in the <em class="small">MOOC</em> shuffle. In a five-year-long study of over fifty thousand students taking both online and face-to-face courses, researchers at Troy University found that online classes had higher failure rates than traditional classroom courses. When Di Xu, an economist at Columbia University’s Teachers College, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_higher_education/v085/85.5.xu.html" target="_blank">analyzed</a> data from more than forty thousand students who had enrolled in online courses at thirty-four colleges throughout Washington state, she found that, relative to face-to-face courses, online students earned lower grades and were less persistent. But not all students fared equally: she found that some subsets struggled more than others. Those subsets were male students, younger students, black students, and students who had lower G.P.A.s. What Xu found, in other words, was that <em class="small">MOOC</em>s were the least effective at serving the students who needed educational resources the most.</p><p>So what’s the solution? How can <em class="small">MOOC</em>s live up to their promise? One possibility is to go back in order to go forward. The <em class="small">MOOC</em> movement started off in a tech whirlwind; the people who pushed it forward were so caught up in its technological possibilities that they scarcely considered decades of research into educational psychology. They might, for instance, have looked at the work of the researchers Patrick Suppes and Richard Atkinson, who in 1962 were charged with designing a course that would use the latest computer technology to teach mathematics and reading to children in kindergarten through third grade. Suppes, a Stanford psychologist and philosopher who had been trained in mathematics, decided to use something called “control theory” as the basis for his approach. Students in his computer-based class wouldn’t all receive the same instruction. Instead, their materials and the order in which those materials were presented would shift according to their past performance and other learning metrics—much like the G.R.E.’s adjusted sections, which become harder or easier depending on how you’re doing. Some students might get stopped every fifteen minutes for a reassessment and summary of materials; others might go for an hour before they reach a stopping point. The approach combined leveling (in which the same material is presented at different learning and reading levels, depending on the student) with dynamic learning (which involves playing around with the manner and order in which information is presented, so that students don’t get bored or frustrated).</p><p>The Suppes-Atkinson courses proved so successful that they were soon expanded to include multiple subjects for many age levels. A company called the Computer Curriculum Corporation (which is now a part of Pearson) started distributing them globally. In 1966, the psychologist William Estes, a pioneer of mathematical learning theory, including control theory, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2014/july-august-14/from-principles-of-cognitive-science-to-moocs.html" target="_blank">presented</a> a paper at the International Congress of Psychology, held that year in Moscow. He spoke Russian. He’d learned it from a Suppes-Atkinson course.</p><p>Why don’t <em class="small">MOOC</em>s structure their materials in a similar fashion? The technology to do so has only improved, as have the metrics to measure success. Some <em class="small">MOOC</em>s, like mathematics or economics courses, lend themselves to this approach, but even lecture-reliant classes could incorporate the method by, for example, incorporating pauses for reviews and summaries of material, tailored to each student’s comprehension level. As it is, individualized methodology has largely gotten lost in the excitement over technological capabilities and large-group approaches. According to numerous interviews I conducted, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.academicpartnerships.com/sites/default/files/MOOCs_Expectations_and_Reality.pdf" target="_blank">and studies</a> I read, very few <em class="small">MOOC</em>s are using anything like control theory as part of their approach to teaching.</p><p>The other major problem is that <em class="small">MOOC</em>s tend to be set up in a way that minimizes frustration for students (who might drop out at any moment). There often aren’t pop quizzes or the kinds of challenges that can<span data-page="page_final"></span> alienate students in traditional settings. The problem here is that easy learning does not make good learning. In fact, the very tools that we believe make for better education may also make students more likely to quit. More frequent testing, for instance, can improve memory, learning, and retention. And, sometimes, the best test of all is the test that you fail: <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.208.4990" target="_blank">recent work</a> from the cognitive psychologist Elizabeth Ligon Bjork has shown that pre-testing on never-before-seen materials helps students perform better in a subsequent course covering that material. In general, Bjork has found, speed bumps in learning are good—<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/pubs/EBjork_RBjork_2011.pdf" target="_blank">desirable difficulties</a>, she calls them. <em class="small">MOOC</em>s would likely be more effective if they didn’t shy away from challenging students, rather than presenting a fluid experience which gives the false impression of the learning and retention.</p><p>In 2012, Stanford president John Hennessy <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/30/get-rich-u">pronounced</a> that the <em class="small">MOOC</em> was going to be “transformative to education.” But, he added, “We don’t really understand how yet.” Two years later, the landscape remains much the same: <em class="small">MOOC</em>s are a technology with potentially revolutionary implications for education, but without a precise plan for realizing that potential. One way of getting there could be for the leaders of the <em class="small">MOOC</em> movement to look more closely at old methods, from when education was less massive, less open, and entirely offline.</p><p><em class="">Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Di Xu used data collected from students at Washington State University.</em></p></div></div></div><footer

Courses would be conducted by mail and live radio. The basic mission, Crowther declared, was a simple one: to be open to people from all walks of life. “The first, and most urgent task before us is to cater for the many thousands of people, fully capable of a higher education, who, for one reason or another, do not get it, or do not get as much of it as they can turn to advantage, or as they discover, sometimes too late, that they need,” he told his audience. “Men and women drop out through failures in the system,” he continued, “through disadvantages of their environment, through mistakes of their own judgment, through sheer bad luck. These are our primary material.” He then invoked the message emblazoned on the Statue of Liberty: Open University wanted the tired, the poor, the huddled masses. To them, most of all, it opened its doors."],["p","The mission Crowther described is the same one that has driven the proliferation of massive open online courses, or ",["a",{"href":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/20/laptop-u"},["em",{"class":"small"},"MOOC"],"s"],", during the past few years.

The program was the first step of a planned push to incorporate online learning into the California’s public-university system. It was open to would-be college students as well as those who were already enrolled. The analysis found students who had already matriculated performed notably better than those who hadn’t. While overall pass rates were quite low—an average of thirty-three per cent across the three courses in the sample—those who performed the worst were the students who were not already enrolled at the university. In a remedial algebra course, for instance, only a quarter of the students passed, and less than one fifth of the non-matriculated students were among them. To put it in absolute terms, out of eighty-one students in the course, only twenty passed and only six of those were non-matriculated students.

What Xu found, in other words, was that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MOOC"],"s were the least effective at serving the students who needed educational resources the most."],["p","So what’s the solution? How can ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MOOC"],"s live up to their promise? One possibility is to go back in order to go forward. The ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MOOC"]," movement started off in a tech whirlwind; the people who pushed it forward were so caught up in its technological possibilities that they scarcely considered decades of research into educational psychology. They might, for instance, have looked at the work of the researchers Patrick Suppes and Richard Atkinson, who in 1962 were charged with designing a course that would use the latest computer technology to teach mathematics and reading to children in kindergarten through third grade. Suppes, a Stanford psychologist and philosopher who had been trained in mathematics, decided to use something called “control theory” as the basis for his approach. Students in his computer-based class wouldn’t all receive the same instruction. Instead, their materials and the order in which those materials were presented would shift according to their past performance and other learning metrics—much like the G.R.E.’s adjusted sections, which become harder or easier depending on how you’re doing. Some students might get stopped every fifteen minutes for a reassessment and summary of materials; others might go for an hour before they reach a stopping point. The approach combined leveling (in which the same material is presented at different learning and reading levels, depending on the student) with dynamic learning (which involves playing around with the manner and order in which information is presented, so that students don’t get bored or frustrated)."],["p","The Suppes-Atkinson courses proved so successful that they were soon expanded to include multiple subjects for many age levels.

Some ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MOOC"],"s, like mathematics or economics courses, lend themselves to this approach, but even lecture-reliant classes could incorporate the method by, for example, incorporating pauses for reviews and summaries of material, tailored to each student’s comprehension level.

November 18, 2016, ten days after Donald Trump won the Presidential\nelection, [graffiti appeared](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/19/502710608/swastikas-are-painted-at-adam-yauch-park-in-nyc-but-kids-win-the-day) on a Brooklyn Heights playground named after Adam Yauch, a founding\nmember of the Beastie Boys. Yauch, who died in 2012, was Jewish; a\nvandal had spray-painted two swastikas on the equipment and, beneath\nthem, had written, “Go Trump.” The incident received national attention\nnot just for its hateful nature but because it happened in a liberal\nenclave. To me, though, one of the most disturbing aspects wasn’t the\nswastikas themselves but the fact that they had been drawn\nincorrectly—one was backward and the other was misshapen. Apparently,\nthe person engaging in hate speech didn’t know what a Nazi swastika\nlooked like. This was someone trying on the role of anti-Semite for\nsize—someone who hadn’t been a rabid neo-Nazi his whole life but who\nfelt emboldened by the election of the new President. It was a new\nbehavior prompted by a new event. Were such incidents, then, the new\n“normal”? And, if this shift of norms could happen with such speed, in\nsuch an improbable location, then how quickly and how much might the\nnorms of our whole society change?\n\nUnderstanding the psychology of changing norms starts from a simple\ninsight: although we may wish to be perfectly rational and impartial,\nbias is an inescapable part of what it means to be human. At three\nmonths old, we [already prefer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2566511/) the faces\nof people who share our skin color over the faces of those who don’t. By\nfive years old, we’re [aware of our group’s status](https://www.fas.harvard.edu/~mrbworks/articles/2009_Baron_SPPC.pdf) and have imbibed [certain community ideas](https://www.academia.edu/3094721/Children_Are_Not_Colorblind_How_Young_Children_Learn_Race) about how various groups are perceived and treated. As we grow older,\nthese ideas are constantly reinforced by popular culture, our social\nenvironments, and even our language and symbolism. The question,\ntherefore, isn’t “Do biases exist?” but, rather, “How much do we let them\naffect our behavior?” In 1990, Susan Fiske and Steven Neuberg, then\npsychologists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Arizona\nState University, respectively, described the process by which bias\nsways behavior using what they called the “continuum model of impression\nformation.” According to their model, our reliance on stereotypes in\ndecision-making exists on a continuum and shifts by degrees, rather than\noperating in absolutes. No one is ever bias-free, but some people let\ntheir biases influence their actions more than others. “You can’t help\nit if you live in a certain culture,” Fiske, who is now at Princeton\nUniversity, explained to me. “But are you motivated to go beyond\nstereotype?”\n\nTo a large extent, our motivation to overcome our biases depends on\nimplicit social norms, which we assimilate from a variety of sources.\nSometimes we find them in the environment; people are [more likely to litter](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prestos/Downloads/DC/pdfs/Krupka_Oct13_Cialdinietal1990.pdf) in a dirty place than in a clean one, for instance. We also find them in the behavior of people we respect, or who occupy positions we respect.\nIf someone in a powerful position acts in a certain way or expresses a\ncertain view, we implicitly assume that those actions and views are\nassociated with power, and that emulating them may be to our advantage.\nAs a result, while our biases may be slow to change—they’re based on\nlong-standing stereotypes, and we have been learning them since\nbirth—our norms can shift at the speed of social life. We might think of\nanti-Semitism as stemming from deeply rooted beliefs, and, in some\nsense, that’s true, but the expression of anti-Semitism depends on\nhighly changeable facts about our social environment.\n\nBetsy Levy Paluck, a psychologist at Princeton University who just [received](https://www.macfound.org/fellows/995/) a MacArthur\n“genius” grant, has spent her career studying how shifting social norms affect behavior. In the early\naughts, she studied the profound shift in relations between the Hutus\nand the Tutsis at the time of the Rwandan genocide. Prior to the\ncarnage, Paluck told me, “Hutus reported such good relations with their\nTutsi neighbors”; then, in an instant, one group massacred the other.\nWhat Paluck observed during her time in Rwanda wasn’t the power of\nage-old hatreds—Hutus and Tutsis had always had stereotyped ideas about\none another—but of quickly shifting social norms. To a great extent, the\nnorms in Rwanda shifted so rapidly because they did so from the top:\ninfluential radio stations broadcast a powerful, persuasive, and\nconstantly repeating message urging listeners to join killing squads and\norganize roadblocks. “That was the voice of authority,” Paluck\nexplained. Suddenly, people saw violence as something that wasn’t just\npossible but normal.\n\nThe voice of authority speaks not for the one but for the many;\nauthority figures have a strong and rapid effect on social norms in part\nbecause they change our assumptions about what other people think. In\nthe United States, one way to study that effect is to examine the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, a universally acknowledged source of\nauthority. In a study in the September, 2017, issue of *Psychological Science*, Paluck and Margaret Tankard, of the *RAND*{:.small} Corporation, look at the change in American attitudes toward same-sex marriage before and\nafter the Supreme Court decision that established it as a constitutional\nright, in June, 2015. In the months before the decision, Paluck and\nTankard surveyed people in cities all over the country; they then\nrepeated the survey after the decision was announced. They found that,\nwhile personal opinions on same-sex marriage hadn’t shifted in the wake\nof the ruling, people’s perception of others’ opinions had changed\nalmost immediately. Americans, whether liberal or conservative, thought\nthat their fellow-citizens now supported same-sex marriage more than\nbefore, even though, in reality, the only thing that had changed was the\nruling of a public institution. The impression created by the ruling was\nthat “more Americans currently support same-sex marriage, and that even\nmore will support it in the future,” Paluck said.\n\nOur tendency to extrapolate the opinions of others from the opinions of\nauthority figures helps explain phenomena like the incorrectly drawn\nswastikas on the playground in Brooklyn. The psychology of norms\nsuggests that you don’t “need a nation of raging anti-Semites to license\nthe use of anti-Semitism as a social weapon,” Paluck said. Instead, an\nauthority figure could make the expression of anti-Semitism—an old bias\nthat had previously been subtle, implicit, and almost\nimperceptible—suddenly appear to be one of the broadly “acceptable” ways\nof showing pent-up anger. “A leader could whip up everyone’s frustration\nand channel it to these scapegoats and make it normative to use this\nlanguage,” Paluck said, “encouraging people to say, ‘Ah, this is how to\nexpress my frustration, to lash out against liberalism and so-called\nélites.’ ” Such an authority figure can create the impression of a\nsocial consensus where none exists.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWhat can we do to counteract the rise of violent and hateful new norms?\nThe social psychologist Bibb Latané argues that norms are more readily\ntransmitted when the person modelling them has a high degree of personal\ninfluence and is physically close by the person absorbing them; a\nstudent, for example, is more likely to be affected by her professor\nthan by a fellow-student or a professor at another school. One\npossibility, therefore, is to call upon influential people in small\ncommunities to fight the perceived consensus created by larger authority\nfigures. If the President suggests that some neo-Nazis are “very fine\npeople,” but those in positions of power closer to you—such as a pastor,\nprincipal, or governor—speak out against him, you’ll be more likely to\ncall into question the new normal that the President has modelled. The\nnew behavior will look more like an outlier than like a norm.\n\nLast year, Kevin Munger, a Ph.D. candidate at New York University, found\na novel way to [test](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-016-9373-5) this hypothesis. He created Twitter bots that would speak out against racist harassment by automatically tweeting at users who had previously\ntweeted anti-black slurs. All the bots were made to appear male, but\nthey varied along other dimensions: they were either white or black, and\nthey had either few followers (that is, not much of a perceived\ninfluence) or many. Munger found that one particular group was able to\nshift behavior: white men who appeared to be influential. After\nreceiving just one admonishment from such a user (for example, “Hey man,\njust remember that there are real people who are hurt when you harass\nthem with that kind of language”), people significantly reduced their\nuse of slurs over a period of two months.\n\nAlong with the sociologist Hana Shepherd and the psychologist Peter\nAronow, Paluck has run a study with a similar approach at fifty-six\nmiddle schools (that is, at fifty-six incubators of bullying and\nharassment). After performing a social-network analysis on the schools’\ntwenty-four thousand students—identifying who hangs out with whom, who\nlistens to whose opinions, and so on—Paluck and her colleagues chose\nseveral dozen students from each school, including representatives of\nvarious subsets of the school population, and had them participate in\nanti-harassment training. The students were encouraged to speak to their\npeers, suggesting ways in which others could be made to feel more\ncomfortable in school. In the schools that received this intervention,\nharassment fell by thirty per cent over the course of a year.\n\nThe lesson, Paluck believes, is that influence must spread from all\nrelevant communities to be effective. In middle-school terms, you need\nboth “the kids who are really popular in marching band” and “the leader\nof the goths” to help change norms. This insight has implications for\nthose of us who want to push back against the Trump Administration’s new\nnormal—the use of emotionally riling speech and epithets, threats of\nmedia bans, and so on. Hand-wringing and anger from within “the\nresistance” is of limited value. The middle-school approach requires\nparticipation from every political group. Democrats, therefore, must\nreach out to leaders in the Republican community and ask them to model a\ndifferent sort of norm. Moderate Republicans must reach out to\nsympathetic but less vocal colleagues. “Implore your Republican\nneighbors to get their formal or informal leaders to speak out,” Paluck\nsaid. A broad-based, authoritative counterbalance may well have an\nimpact.\n\nThe beauty of norms is that, unlike ingrained hatreds, they are\nflexible. They shift quickly; with the right pressure from the right\npeople, they can shift back. But the response, crucially, must be broad,\nand it must come from sources of authority across the political\nspectrum. Otherwise, behaviors we think of as socially stable may prove\nto be far more fragile than we’d like to believe.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” President Trump said Tuesday at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, in Washington, D.C. He was referring, rather obliquely, to a spate of [recent bomb scares and acts of vandalism](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/st-louis-responds-to-a-rise-in-anti-semitism), part of an uptick in hate crimes that has occurred since his arrival on the political scene. Trump’s sentiment, however forced, was welcome, given the obtuseness, ambivalence, and even denial that have characterized his past responses to the problem. As a candidate and a President, he has seemed oddly untroubled by the license that anti-Semites derive from the us-against-them motif of his rants. But now, Trump says, the bigotry “has to stop, and it’s going to stop.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWould that it were that simple. Anti-Semitism is not a run-of-the-mill example of “hate and prejudice and evil,” which is why contempt for Jews keeps showing up as a symptom of social stress—even now, and even in the United States. One needn’t posit an “eternal anti-Semitism,” in Hannah Arendt’s warning phrase, to know that the imagination of the West has always defined itself positively against the negative other of Jewishness. That was blatantly the case in Germany in the sixteenth century, when Martin Luther characterized Jews as “vermin” within the German body politic, “a pest in the midst of our lands.” That belief ultimately came to flower, of course, in the exterminating anti-Semitism of Hitler, who saw the very existence of Jews as a mortal threat to the Thousand-Year Reich. But, as the Holocaust revealed, this fear infected both Nazi ideology and the broader Western consciousness. The crime of genocide may have been enacted by the Nazis, but Jews died as they did because the rest of Europe—and America, too—excluded them from moral concern.\n\n\n\nReligious anti-Judaism, which became racial anti-Semitism, began long before Luther, stretching all the way back to the Gospels themselves. It is not just that Jews are labelled as Christ’s killers in the Passion narratives, but that Jesus is fully portrayed throughout the texts as fiercely opposed to his own Jewish people. (“He came unto His own and His own received him not,” John 1:11 says.) If Jesus was merciful, Jews were condemning; if Jesus was egalitarian, Jews were hierarchical; if Jesus was generous, Jews were greedy. Soon enough, Christians imagined that Jesus had never really been Jewish to begin with. Never mind that this was a terrible mistake of memory, that he was a faithful, law-observing, Shema-proclaiming Jew to the end, and that, John’s words notwithstanding, the only ones to receive Jesus in his lifetime were Jews. The imagined conflict persisted, and it informed the structure of Christian theology—church against synagogue, New Testament against Old, Christian god of mercy against Jewish god of judgment. Down through the centuries, this positive-negative bipolarity formed the twin pillars of European consciousness, and, whenever the social equilibrium shook, Jews were targeted. When the targeting reached its genocidal peak, in the twentieth century, the old hatred was exposed once and for all.\n\n\n\nWell, not quite for all. The Holocaust was a world-historic epiphany, but not to the Trump Administration, which last month erased the Holocaust’s most salient feature by deliberately omitting any reference to Jews from the White House’s [official statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/statement-president-international-holocaust-remembrance-day) on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Trump’s generalizing in that statement—“the victims, survivors, heroes”—wholly ignored the fact that Hitler’s industrialized death machine was created expressly to eliminate one particular people. To neglect that purpose is to restrict responsibility for the broad civilizational crime, with roots in the religious anti-Judaism of the Christian Church, to a small gang of Nazi thugs, as if no one else were guilty. Both the neglecting and the restricting are forms of Holocaust denial.\n\n\n\nIf it is too much for Trump to grasp anti-Semitism as the bug in the software of the West, it is not likely that he will see how his own Islamophobia comes from the same malicious code. When Christendom launched the Crusades, the holy wars that shaped Europe, in the eleventh century, Jews were the paradigmatic enemy inside (the infidel near at hand), and Muslims became the defining enemy outside (the infidel far away). Little wonder, then, that the First Crusade coincided with some of the earliest German pogroms, known as the Rhineland massacres. Within a few hundred years, the Spanish Inquisition had instituted its blood-purity laws, which lumped Muslims and Jews together in a new category of biological inferiority. In 1492 and 1502, first Jews and then Muslims were declared personae non gratae in Spain, facing forced conversion, expulsion, or death. The invention of racism in Europe, in other words, aligned neatly with the discovery of the New World and the advent of colonialism. Genocide and slavery followed.\n\n\n\nIslamophobia is thus, to use the phrase that Edward Said applied to Orientalism, “a strange secret sharer of Western anti-Semitism.” This hidden alignment was particularly discernible in the ease with which the Cold War, with its ubiquitous, if subliminal, anti-Semitism, morphed into the clash of civilizations, with jihadists replacing Reds as figments of the American nightmare. Trump no doubt regards himself as an American original, but he is only the latest ringmaster of this binary circus. In fact, our temperamental President is bigotry’s cliché. Even the cult of white supremacy on which his movement depends has its origins, too, in the positive-negative structure of the Western imagination, a structure erected in the first place to keep Jews in their place. It may offend Donald Trump to be linked to an ancient current, but while his arrival, with all its mayhem, is an unprecedented crime against democratic values, it is also evidence of the deeper disorder from which our culture has yet to recover.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-donald-trump-doesnt-understand-about-anti-semitism","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ccb397f5b30646d065a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Anti-Semitism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"anti-semitism"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1ccc41e4c73c088d77ee","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Holocaust","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"holocaust"},{"id":"5c2e1ccc4a08312cd3aa6ca8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Islamophobia","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"islamophobia"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b4da97f12ef9160ae6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/james-carroll","email":"","name":"James Carroll","socialMedia":[],"title":"James Carroll is the author of twenty books, including, most recently, the novel “[The Cloister](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071GJBSFP/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).”"}]},"dek":"","hed":"What Donald Trump Doesn’t Understand About Anti-Semitism","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2018-11-02T22:33:43.336Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"59097e7d019dfc3494ea3cff","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1316,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2017/05/03/59097e7d019dfc3494ea3cfe_Carroll-WhatDonaldTrumpDoesntUnderstandAboutAnti-Semitism.jpg"}},"caption":"Hatred of Jews, like hatred of Muslims, is embedded more deeply in the Western consciousness than President Trump seems to understand.","altText":"Photograph of Donald Trump in a blue jacket and red tie","credit":"PHOTOGRAPH BY OLIVIER DOULIERY / GETTY","filename":"Carroll-WhatDonaldTrumpDoesntUnderstandAboutAnti-Semitism.jpg","revision":4,"tags":[],"title":"carroll-whatdonaldtrumpdoesntunderstandaboutanti-semitism","notes":"_wordpress_id:3317823","variants":{}}]},"promoDek":"","promoHed":"","pubDate":"2017-02-23T16:55:38.000Z","related":[],"rubric":"","seoDescription":"James Carroll on Donald Trump, who grudgingly acknowledged bomb threats against U.S. Jewish institutions and omitted Jews from a Holocaust Day statement.","seoTitle":"What Donald Trump Doesn’t Understand About Anti-Semitism","socialDescription":"Hatred of Jews, like hatred of Muslims, is embedded more deeply in the Western consciousness than the President seems to understand.","socialTitle":"What Donald Trump Doesn’t Understand About Anti-Semitism","subChannel":"","tags":["Anti-Semitism","Donald Trump","Holocaust","Islamophobia","_wordpress_id:3317671"],"template":"standard","url":"/news/news-desk/what-donald-trump-doesnt-understand-about-anti-semitism","videos":{}},{"id":"59d4ed911211616b7fd10956","modelName":"article","collection":"articles","body":"-=-=-=\n\nThis summer, after a loose coalition of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and Confederate apologists announced that they would hold a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, promotional flyers began to circulate on the Internet. The flyers included a list of names: the self-proclaimed thought leaders who planned to speak at the rally, arranged, Coachella-like, in order of prominence. At the top of the list was Richard Spencer, who coined the term “alt-right” almost a decade ago, and who has been so successful at making himself the poster boy of the movement that he was once sucker punched while standing on a sidewalk in Washington, D.C. Farther down the list were Jason Kessler, the Charlottesville resident who organized the rally; Matthew Heimbach, who has been called “the affable, youthful face of hate in America”; and Christopher Cantwell, who would later star in a Vice documentary about Charlottesville, unpacking a small arsenal of guns and saying, among other things, “We’re not nonviolent—we’ll fucking kill these people if we have to.”\n\nThe second person listed on the flyers, immediately below Spencer, was a white-nationalist shock jock named Mike Enoch. The name might have been unfamiliar to most Americans, but, to an inner cadre of Web-fluent neo-fascists, Enoch is an influential and divisive figure. In May, David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, tweeted, “Hate him or love him—Mike Enoch is someone to pay close attention to.” Just three years ago, Enoch could be heard mocking Spencer (“talks like a fag”) and Cantwell (“a dickhead turtle”), criticizing their ideologies as too extreme. But that was before his radicalization was complete. These days, Enoch routinely refers to African-Americans as “animals” and “savages,” and expresses “skepticism” about how many Jews died in the Holocaust. Apart from interviews with Spencer and Cantwell, who are now his close friends and ideological allies, he largely eschews attention from the media. He prefers to speak—voluminously, articulately, and with an uncanny lack of emotion—on his own podcast, “The Daily Shoah.” (The title, a pun about the Holocaust by way of Comedy Central, reflects the over-all tone of the show.) “The Daily Shoah” is the most popular of more than two dozen podcasts on the Right Stuff, a Web site that Enoch founded in 2012\\. Once an obscure blog about “post-libertarian” politics, the site is now a breeding ground for some of the most florid racism on the Internet. One of its pages is set up to accept donations, in dollars or bitcoins; another is devoted to “fashy memes,” songs and images that extol fascism in an antic, joking-but-not-joking tone. The podcasts—meandering, amateurish talk shows hosted by bilious young men who make Rush Limbaugh sound like Mr. Rogers—are not available on iTunes, Spotify, or any other major platform, and yet collectively they draw tens of thousands of listeners a week.\n\nThe Charlottesville rally, on August 12th, immediately erupted in violence, and the police shut it down before any of the speakers could take the stage. A few of them reconvened in a park two miles away. Enoch, surrounded by small concentric circles of reporters, protesters, and counterprotesters, stood on a wooden riser in the shade of a dogwood tree. A tall, stout man with a husky voice and a grim, downturned mouth, he wore aviator sunglasses, a slight beard, and the unofficial uniform of the day: khakis and a white polo shirt. “We’re here to talk about white genocide, the deliberate and intentional displacement of the white race,” he said. “Have we heard this conspiracy theory of white privilege? This is a concept that was brought to us by Jewish intellectuals, to undermine our confidence in ourselves.” He finished his remarks and introduced the next speaker, David Duke. An hour later, James Alex Fields, Jr., wearing khakis and a white polo, drove a car into a crowd of people, killing Heather Heyer, a local counterprotester.\n\nEnoch’s father, who is also named Mike, spent that Saturday at home. He lives in an upper-middle-class New Jersey suburb that is often listed among the most progressive towns in the country. “I made breakfast, and at some point I mowed the lawn,” he said recently. “Then, as I do every day, I sat down to read the New York _Times_.” He saw a photograph of a torch-wielding mob taken in Charlottesville the previous night. “I looked at the picture for a while, and I couldn’t find Mike anywhere,” he said. He scrutinized other photos online, and still didn’t see his son. “I said, ‘Thank God,’ and I went about my day.”\n\nOn Sunday, after he got home from church, he saw that a relative had e-mailed him a YouTube link. He clicked on it: his son and David Duke, standing shoulder to shoulder. “It turned my stomach,” he said. “Until that moment, I had imagined that, whatever had caused him to go down this path, it could somehow be reversed, and he could come home again.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nMost of the bloggers and commenters on the Right Stuff use pseudonyms—Sneering Imperialist, Toilet Law, Ebolamericana, Death. “Mike Enoch” is a pseudonym, too. Over the years, on “The Daily Shoah,” he occasionally dropped hints about his identity, though he was careful not to reveal too much. He said that he lived with his wife in New York City—“which narrows it down to me and eight million other people”—and that he worked at a “normie” day job, which he would surely lose if his employers ever learned about his alter ego. As a child, he had attended church camps and public schools, where he’d been “programmed” to believe in universalism and equality. Most members of his immediate family were still “shitlibs”—committed liberals who had not yet seen the error of their ways.\n\nIn January, a group of anti-fascist activists dug up his personal information and released it against his will—an Internet-specific form of retribution known as doxing. Mike Enoch was actually Michael Enoch Isaac Peinovich, a thirty-nine-year-old computer programmer who worked at an e-publishing company and lived on the Upper East Side. As predicted, he lost his job. Someone printed out color photographs of his face and pasted them to telephone poles on the corner of Eighty-second Street and York Avenue: “Say Hi to Your Neo-Nazi Neighbor, Mike Peinovich!” The dox revealed that he had an older sister, a social worker who treated traumatized children, and an adopted younger brother, who was biracial and cognitively impaired. Perhaps most baffling of all, Mike’s wife, who was also identified in the dox, turned out to be Jewish.\n\nAt first, Enoch tried to insist that he wasn’t Peinovich, but he soon put up a post on the Right Stuff confirming his identity: “I won’t even bother denying it.” On white-nationalist message boards, including the Right Stuff itself, a few commenters accused Enoch of being “controlled opposition,” or demanded that he divorce his wife. (“I can’t believe all you fags still support this Jew fucker!”) Some held out for more information (“How Jewish? Because if 1/4 or less, I don’t give a shit”); others changed the subject (“I’m more disappointed by how fat he is than anything”).\n\nA few days later, on “The Daily Shoah,” Enoch and his co-hosts read dozens of notes from listeners who were remaining loyal to the podcast, some of whom had donated money to Enoch in his time of need. “My heart goes out to his wife,” one fan, a long-distance trucker, wrote. “If she is married to Mike, she must be a good individual.”\n\n“That is a really nice thing to say,” Enoch said. “I’m sure she’ll appreciate that.” He didn’t mention that his wife had gone to stay with her mother in the Midwest.\n\nAlso included in the dox were two e-mail addresses, both purportedly belonging to Enoch. In general, I am opposed to doxing—I worry about vigilante mobs, false positives, slippery slopes—but not opposed enough, apparently, to overcome my curiosity. I e-mailed both addresses.\n\nEnoch responded right away. He said that he didn’t want to talk—“I have a platform to tell my story that is bigger than yours”—and yet, every time I sent another e-mail, he sent one back. I made no secret of the fact that I found his views repugnant, but I added, truthfully, that I wanted to know how he’d ended up in this predicament and what he planned to do next. At one point, I wrote him a long note trying to persuade him to talk to me. His entire response was “You seem kinda mad.” We went back and forth for a while, but I had no real success in drawing him out, and eventually we both lost interest.\n\nHe later read our full exchange on “The Daily Shoah.” To his credit, he didn’t edit his responses to make them sound smarter, but he didn’t have to. According to the rules of online debate in the Right Stuff’s “Essential T.R.S. Troll Guide,” which I hadn’t read at the time, Enoch had won our exchange by default, because he had written fewer words and maintained his ironic detachment, whereas I had committed the greatest possible faux pas: letting myself be “triggered” into displaying emotion. After the podcast aired, a few of Enoch’s fans sent me nasty messages on Twitter. I figured that was the end of it.\n\nThen I heard back from the other e-mail address. “I am not the Mike Peinovich to whom you addressed this email, but I am his father,” it read. “Until two days ago, I was totally unaware of his ‘alt-right’ activities. . . . I am struggling to understand how Mike E. (which is what we call him to distinguish him from me and my father who was also Mike Peinovich) could have said, posted or tweeted the things that are attributed to him.”\n\nI called Mike, Sr., and we talked for a long time. It was the week of Donald Trump’s Inauguration, and he spoke in the tone that a lot of liberals were using then—weary and a bit dazed, as if struggling to shake a bad dream. “We tried to give our kids good values,” he said. “Mike E. went to good schools, and he loved being part of his church youth group. We knew that he was an outspoken Trump supporter, and he was very much the only one in the family, so we agreed, at a certain point, not to talk about politics.” He had listened to the podcast for long enough to recognize his son’s voice and profane sense of humor, but lasted only a few minutes before turning it off.\n\nFour days after the rally in Charlottesville, I went to meet Mike, Sr., and his wife, Billie, in New Jersey. They live in an Arts and Crafts house on a tree-lined block near the center of town. Mike, Sr., answered the door. He was taller and thinner than his son, with silver hair and rimless glasses, but I saw the resemblance right away: the square jaw, the downturned mouth.\n\nBillie and Mike are retired, and they spend several months a year travelling. They gave me a tour of the house, pointing out items they’d collected: Persian rugs, Mexican pottery, a floor-mounted globe. Mike was once a professor of Old English at the University of Pennsylvania, and his study contains several dictionaries and translations of “[Beowulf](https://www.amazon.com/Beowulf-New-Verse-Translation-Bilingual/dp/0393320979/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1507560238&sr=1-1&keywords=beowulf),” along with contemporary books such as Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “[Between the World and Me](https://www.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0812993543/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1507560256&sr=1-1&keywords=Between+the+World+and+Me).” We sat in armchairs in the living room, and he talked at length about his ancestors. “My grandfather helped drive the K.K.K. out of North Dakota,” he said. “My other grandfather came from Yugoslavia, fleeing religious persecution.”\n\nBillie, who was a psychiatric social worker for many years, spoke in the language of therapy. Mike E.’s parents broke up when he was three, and Billie married into the family a few years later; as far as she was concerned, she was as much Mike E.’s parent as anyone. “I feel shock and anger,” she said. “I also feel shame, which is irrational, because I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. I think he brought this on himself because he wants to distance himself from us, from everyone, as a form of self-protection.” Then, more quietly, she said, “He must be so lonely.”\n\nBillie wondered aloud how to tell their friends and family about Mike E. “What do you do?” she said. “Send a letter to your cousins—‘Haven’t spoken to you in twenty years, hope you’re doing well, and, oh, P.S., our son’s a Nazi now’?” She worried that people would wonder what she and Mike, Sr., had done wrong as parents. “Everyone wants it to be simple, to know who to blame,” one of Mike E.’s relatives told me later. “But lots of kids have parents who get divorced when they’re young. Lots of white kids have difficult personalities. They don’t all become Nazis.”\n\nA few people around town had already heard the news, mostly through Facebook, and some of them were talking about Mike E. as if he had been abducted by a cult, or tied down and injected with a serum of pure hatred. Other people assumed that there must be some key biographical fact—a chemical imbalance, a history of abuse—that would neatly unlock the mystery. But Mike E.’s conversion was more quotidian than that, and therefore more unsettling; somehow, over time, he had fallen into a particularly dark rabbit hole, where some of the most disturbing and discredited ideas in modern history were repackaged as the solution to twenty-first-century malaise.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs a child, Mike E. suffered from severe asthma and eczema. In most old photographs, his face is red and swollen and his shoulders are hunched, a sign that he is straining to catch his breath. The Peinoviches spent one summer at a lake house in Ohio, where the air was fresh and Mike E. found it easier to breathe; still, he went swimming with his shirt on, because his skin was covered with scratches and open sores. “When we walked through an airport or a mall with our younger son, we would get stopped and told what a beautiful child we had,” Billie said. “Not with Mike E.”\n\nHe was so allergic to so many things—dust, pollen, nuts, wheat, shellfish—that he carried an EpiPen almost everywhere he went. At birthday parties, while the other children ate ice cream and cake, he ate saltines. “A few months ago, for some reason, it became a joke on the alt-right to talk about drinking milk,” someone who knew Mike E. as a child told me. On Twitter, “his bio said, ‘Lactose tolerant’—as code for, you know, white power. But the funny thing was, anyone who knew him knew that any exposure to dairy would make him sick.”\n\nIn 1980, Mike E.’s mother left Mike, Sr., and she later moved out of the state. The divorce was ugly, and for many years she rarely saw the children. Mike E. was sent to a series of therapists, who mentioned potential disorders, but nothing definitive. One therapist, instead of giving a diagnosis, said that Mike E. was “as vulnerable as a peeled grape.”\n\nGradually, he learned to insulate himself with jokes and insults. He was clever, and found strength in contrarianism. His ideology shifted over time, but his approach was always the same: exposing and attacking the flaws in commonplace arguments, often without any sense of proportion. Even when he agreed with someone’s opinion, he still loved to engage in rhetorical battle—not to advance any particular agenda, one of his relatives told me, but “to stir up resentment. He strikes me as someone without a core, who only knows how to oppose and who chooses his positions based on what will be most upsetting to people around him.”\n\nHe grew up listening to the Jerky Boys, virtuosos of the scatological prank call, and to Opie and Anthony, a pair of afternoon-radio comedians who always seemed to be daring their station managers to fire them. Opie and Anthony, in particular, revelled in boundary-pushing for its own sake. For several years, they held a “Most Offensive Song Contest.” Crowd favorites included “Baby Raper” and “Stuck in an Oven with Jews.” Such songs were not actually calling for genocide, of course. The point was to flout as many taboos as possible. Anyone who didn’t find it funny was urged to grow a thicker skin.\n\nThis aesthetic now thrives on forums like 4chan and the Right Stuff, where the dominant modes of self-expression are trolling and “shitposting”—transcribing the motley contents of one’s id, the more bizarre or abhorrent the better. But, compared with terrestrial radio or network TV, the Internet offers fewer direct boundaries to push against; there are no station managers to thumb your nose at. If “Stuck in an Oven with Jews” was shocking before social media, the race to the bottom has since accelerated into free fall.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nMike E.’s high school was diverse and academically rigorous. (His sister’s classmates included Zach Braff and Lauryn Hill.) He had the sort of grades that are common among smart but disobedient kids: A’s in classes that interested him, D’s and F’s when he was bored or felt that the teacher didn’t deserve his respect. He went to Ohio University to study graphic design, but dropped out after the first quarter. He studied at two Rutgers campuses, then took computer-programming classes at Pace University, but left without a degree. “Mike E. took his fourth run at college and finally faced the fact that he is not suited to academic life,” the family’s 2006 Christmas letter read. He moved to Bushwick, in Brooklyn, taught himself how to code, and eventually got a lucrative job as a back-end programmer at AOL. His supervisor there was a blond woman from the Midwest, a musician and photographer who shared many of his interests—sci-fi movies, medieval history, recondite Internet humor. They started dating. Her father was born Jewish and her mother had converted to Judaism, but Mike E. hardly found this remarkable; half the people he grew up with were Jewish, including his high-school girlfriend. The Christmas letter continued, “Though he commutes into Manhattan to a corporate job, he’s still the non-conformist that he always was.”\n\nHe and the supervisor got married and moved to a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. (Their wedding ceremony was mostly secular, but they recited a prayer and stomped on a glass.) She maintained a blog, reviewing local rock concerts and drag-queen shows, and she often talked about a fantasy novel she hoped to write. To get his eczema under control, Mike E. ordered large doses of prednisone, a prescription steroid, from an Indian Web site, and took it without medical supervision. Prednisone’s side effects include depression, agitation, weight gain, and vision problems. He gained so much weight that he was almost unrecognizable, and he went temporarily blind in one eye, necessitating emergency cataract surgery.\n\nGradually, he and his wife stopped going out with their friends from Bushwick, then stopped going out much at all. Instead they stayed home, playing video games or reading on their laptops. Mike E. spent hours in political-debate forums on Facebook and Reddit, where he let his contrarian side run wild. Online, no one was keeping track of his opinions. No one even knew his name, or what he looked like. It felt like another video game. Sometimes he would stake out a seemingly indefensible position, then see if he could invent an argument to back it up.\n\nIt was obvious to him that the country was profoundly off track, and that both major political parties were morally and intellectually bankrupt. The only question was which utopian system should replace the current one. He read books by Noam Chomsky and articles on antiwar.com, which published critiques of American foreign policy from the far left and the far right. He dabbled in leftist anarchism, but discovered glaring flaws in the ideology; after that, he became a Trotskyist. One Saturday, he later wrote, he found himself at a meeting “in a run down YMCA in Brooklyn with a group of middle-aged Jewish public school teachers.” They were discussing what stance to take on Islamic terrorism. “An overwhelming sense of loathing washed over me like an awesome wave,” he wrote. “The people I was around suddenly seemed twisted and horrible. A revelatory religious experience is the closest thing I can compare this experience to.”\n\nHe began reading books by Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard, and Ludwig von Mises, the grandfather of libertarianism. For a few years, he was an enthusiastic and doctrinaire libertarian. He started a blog called the Emptiness, where he wrote posts such as “Socialism Is Selfish” and “Taxation Is Theft.” Through online debate forums, he met a few like-minded friends—a painting contractor from upstate New York, an E.M.T. from Virginia, a devout Christian from Tennessee. They called themselves “post-libertarians,” though they weren’t sure what would come next. In a private Facebook group, they debated the merits of various micro-ideologies—paleoconservatism, neo-reaction, radical traditionalism—and made jokes that were too self-referential or too offensive to share with the wider public. Each time Mike E. adopted a new world view, he was able to convince himself that his conversion was rational, even inevitable.\n\nWithin a few years, he started to wonder whether libertarianism was too tepid. After all, its premises pointed toward a starker conclusion: if the state was nothing but a hindrance to freedom, why not abolish the state altogether, leaving only the unfettered market? From there, he went even further. What if you couldn’t account for people’s behavior without considering their cultural background, and even their genetic makeup? “Slapped in the face by the reality of human bio-diversity,” he later wrote, “I had to come to grips with the fact that libertarianism isn’t going to work for everyone, and the people that it isn’t going to work for are going to ruin it for everyone else.” Human biodiversity: the idea that people are different, that they differ in predictable ways, and that some people—not just individuals but groups of people—might be inherently superior to others.\n\nHe thought he had carefully examined each of his beliefs, reducing them to their most fundamental axioms. But here was an axiom so fundamental that he hadn’t even articulated it to himself, much less subjected it to logical scrutiny. Now that he thought about it, he wasn’t sure why he should assume that all people were equal. Maybe they weren’t. If this was a textbook definition of racism, then so be it—maybe racism was true. “They’re fucking religious fanatics,” he said later, of liberals like his former self. “They believe in the equality of human beings like a Muslim believes that he has to pray five times facing Mecca, or like a Southern Baptist hates the devil. . . . If you’re a liberal, you’ve never thought twice, you’ve never reconsidered, you’ve absorbed what you were taught in the government schools and by the TV.”\n\nThe idea of racial hierarchy seemed to hold enormous explanatory power. As a liberal, he had dealt with troubling facts—the achievement gap between black students and white students, say—by invoking the history of racial oppression, or by explaining why the data didn’t show what they appeared to show. As a Marxist, he had attributed unpleasant facts to capitalist exploitation; as a libertarian, he had blamed the state. But all those explanations were abstract at best, muddled at worst, and they required levels of context that were impossible to convey in a Facebook post. Now he was free to revert to a far simpler explanation: maybe white people had more wealth and power because white people were superior. After arguing himself out of every previous position, he had finally found the perfect ideology for an inveterate contrarian—one that presented such a basic affront to the underlying tenets of modern democracy that he would never run out of enemies.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59d8000a0ead543b15308d15]||||||\n+++\n\nHe felt the urge to explain what he was learning to his co-workers, his parents, and his sister, but he knew that they wouldn’t understand. He stopped haranguing his family about tax policy and the Federal Reserve. They assumed that he had lost interest in politics, and he didn’t bother to correct them.\n\nIn December, 2012, with friends from his post-libertarian Facebook group, he started the Right Stuff. “We’re right wingers,” the About Us page read, “but we welcome comments from intelligent and civil people across the political spectrum.” A few months later, the About Us page was edited: “While unabashedly authoritarian, fash-ist, and theocratic, we welcome comments from intelligent and civil people across the political spectrum.” In 2016, the page was amended yet again: “Even though you are wrong, we are open to outside opinions. . . . Also we’re white and we’re not sorry.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe Right Stuff’s podcasts are laden with acronyms, abbreviations, and inside jokes. (At one point, the site published a “T.R.S. Lexicon,” a glossary for newcomers.) Some of the neologisms are unique to T.R.S.; others would be familiar to anyone who spends a lot of time in certain parts of the Internet. A person who takes on an overly theatrical identity, for example, is “larping”—live-action role-playing. A “red pill” is a transformative bit of knowledge that is supposed to subvert left-wing brainwashing. (“Red-pill me on that, goy,” one “Daily Shoah” co-host might say to another, asking to be brought up to speed on the latest white-nationalist thinking.) The tone of a discussion can swing, sometimes within a single sentence, from sincerity to sarcasm to reverse sarcasm. These distinctions are so subtle and ever-shifting that the co-hosts sometimes have to tell one another, on air, “I actually meant that,” or “I was just doing a bit.”\n\nBigots these days often claim that the bigoted things they say are ironic, or quasi ironic. Part of what makes this feint so disorienting is that it is sometimes true. When “The Daily Shoah” started, in 2014, its title was not, or not primarily, meant to be earnestly anti-Semitic. “At first, it was a joke,” Enoch explained on Chris Cantwell’s podcast, in May. “It was just a funny pun. But we kinda put ourselves in a box.” The Right Stuff launched other podcasts, each with its own parody logo: “Fash the Nation,” “Nationalist Public Radio,” “Good Morning White America.”\n\nIn the early days, “The Daily Shoah” reserved most of its firepower for its neighbors on the political spectrum, mocking those on the alt-right who reduced all geopolitical issues to a simple Zionist conspiracy. With each episode, though, the co-hosts’ anti-Semitism sounded more sincere. Allusions to gas chambers and ovens became almost a verbal tic. Whenever the co-hosts mentioned a Jewish journalist or politician, they would emphasize the name, pronouncing it in a nasal accent and using a reverb effect. This invention—the Echo, they called it—became one of their signature memes. They approximated it in writing, in the blog and on Twitter, surrounding Jewish names with triple parentheses.\n\nThen, in January, 2015, Enoch read “The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements,” by Kevin MacDonald, a former psychology professor at California State University, Long Beach. The book—published in 1998, heavily footnoted, and roundly debunked by mainstream social scientists—is a touchstone of contemporary intellectualized anti-Semitism. On “The Daily Shoah,” Enoch called it “important and devastating, something I urge everybody to read,” and then offered even higher praise: “It triggered me so hard.” From then on, he began to express his anti-Semitism more frankly. He sometimes spun his Northeastern upbringing as an advantage: having grown up around Jews, he understood the enemy. “You’ll talk to white Americans today, and they don’t actually know if someone’s Jewish or not,” he said. “I have very honed Jewdar. I can tell.”\n\nEnoch still lived with his wife, in the one-bedroom apartment where he recorded “The Daily Shoah.” His wife—they separated in January and are in the process of divorcing—declined to be interviewed for this piece, and no one I talked to, including people who were in a position to know, could fully explain how a Jew and a professional anti-Semite stayed together for so long. “They always talked about everything,” one person told me. “She was his best audience. It’s possible that they never talked about this, but it’s hard to imagine.”\n\nAfter the dox, Mike E.’s parents spoke to his wife, and she told them that, although she was aware that their son hosted a podcast, she didn’t know anything about its contents. This was false. On December 22, 2015, she appeared on “The Daily Shoah” ’s annual Christmas episode to recite a poem, a parody of “A Visit from St. Nicholas.” “She wrote this,” Enoch said, by way of introduction, “and she’s really proud of it.” The poem betrayed a deep familiarity with the show’s tone, and with several of its inside jokes:\n\n> ’Twas a T.R.S. Christmas, and all through the house,  \n> Not a creature was stirring, not even my spouse  \n> The cucks were all prepped for the ovens with care,  \n> Just waiting for morning to pop ’em in there. . . .  \n> Out Communists, out Socialists, out left-libertarians!  \n> Out betas, out allies, S.J.W. contrarians  \n> Out beaners and dindus and Muslim jihadists  \n> Spare us your Syrian-refugee problems  \n> Just fash away, fash away, fash away all!  \n\nSomehow, Enoch’s wife must have convinced herself that the words she was repeating were empty signifiers. She was an aspiring writer, and she presumably wanted to demonstrate to her husband and his friends that she, too, could excel at their game. In the poem, she referred to herself as a troll. Maybe she imagined that she was indulging in a bit of victimless, anonymous humor, another edgy joke that went too far.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nDuring one of my visits to Mike, Sr., and Billie’s house in New Jersey, I met their adopted son, who asked to go by his middle name, Joshua. Before the dox, he and Mike E. had had a good relationship. Every once in a while, Joshua would take a train to New York, they would see a super-hero movie together, and Joshua would sleep over.\n\nAfter Mike E. was doxed, Joshua said, “I was a big target.” Some of Enoch’s followers, apparently upset that he had a nonwhite family member, found Joshua’s Facebook page and sent him threats and obscene images. “I just deleted them, just blocked the people,” Joshua said. “I didn’t even want to acknowledge it.” Joshua has a brain injury, and he tends to express his thoughts simply and flatly; still, it was clear that this had been a harrowing experience. The two brothers haven’t spoken since.\n\nMike, Sr., told me that after he found out about his son’s online persona, in January, he’d seen him only once, in Manhattan, where they met to put a modest inheritance from Mike E.’s grandmother in a trust fund. As they waited in the lobby of a bank, they made awkward small talk. “He told me he’d been going to the gym and not eating carbs,” Mike, Sr., said. “He didn’t say where he was living, or what he was doing with his days, or how he was feeling. It felt like talking to someone I hardly knew.” Before he left, Mike, Sr., made one request: that Mike E. legally change his last name to Enoch, or Paine, or anything, really, other than Peinovich. Mike E. agreed.\n\nThe day after Charlottesville, Mike, Sr., texted him, reminding him of his promise. “Whatever,” Mike E. wrote. He had changed his mind. “This is my final decision. Perhaps if you had shown more sympathy and interest in fairness, my decision would be different.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne Friday afternoon in September, Mike Enoch called my cell phone. “I hear you’ve been talking to my family,” he said. I told him that I’d been hoping to speak to him, but that it would have to wait; I was in the middle of lunch. “What are you having?” he asked. I didn’t want to tell him the real answer—a bagel and lox—so I lied and said I was eating a salad. As if we were on his podcast, he went on a comedic riff about a takeout chain called Just Salad: “I’ve always thought that that was a nice little double entendre, to appeal to social-justice-minded white people.” He was about to board a train to Washington, D.C., so we agreed that he’d call again that night. I assumed that he would record the call, troll me for a few minutes, and then play the audio on his show, as he’d done with other reporters.\n\nIn the end, we spoke for more than two hours. He was surprisingly forthcoming. “My family always larped as Wasps, even though we’re not Anglo-Saxon,” he said. “My dad wore tweed jackets, that whole thing.” His biological mother, he said later, “was always a bit of a race realist on this point. She’s completely Norwegian, while my dad is half Norwegian and half Serbian.” He added, “My mother always said, ‘Your temper comes from your Serbian side.’ I’m quite sure she meant that in a racial sense. And I think there’s something to that.” (His mother, a retired college president in New York, clarified that she meant this “in a cultural sense” and that she is not fully Norwegian.)\n\nI asked him whether he regretted the violence in Charlottesville. “You’ll have to ask Antifa,” he said. “The violence wasn’t initiated by our side.” He described his current ideological position as “white nationalism, or the alt-right, or whatever you wanna call it.” In hindsight, he now says, he was always more wary of African-Americans and Jews than he let on. “I noticed these differences, even when I didn’t necessarily put emphasis on them or think that they were socially deterministic,” he said. He spoke freely about his “intense, personal antipathy for Jews,” but insisted that he did not hate black people: “I just feel sorry for them and see them as a social problem.” I asked how to square this with the fact that he had a black brother. “He’s only a quarter black,” he responded.\n\nA few times, I tried to ask another obvious question: If you never liked Jews, why did you marry one? The first time, he sighed and then said, “I don’t really know.” The next time it came up, he said, “Jews have certain physical features that I don’t think are particularly attractive. She didn’t have those. I thought she was very pretty.” Nor did she exhibit what he considered typical Jewish traits: “The pushiness, this absolute inability to empathize with others, an exploitative personality. She didn’t have any of that.”\n\nWhy did he work so hard, for so many years, to keep his normal life separate from his online alt-right persona? “My wife,” he said without hesitation. “For a long time, I wanted to have it both ways, by just being anonymous on the Internet. But then we got popular.” In 2015, he attended a conference hosted by Richard Spencer’s think tank, the National Policy Institute. Enoch’s identity was still secret, and audience members were asked not to take his photo; still, everyone he talked to recognized his voice, and several people told him that they had bought a ticket because they were hoping to meet him. “At that point, it was, like, O.K., this is getting out of control,” he told me. “I kept saying, ‘It’ll be fine, it’ll be fine.’ But I knew that I was just delaying the inevitable.”\n\nWe talked about “The Culture of Critique,” the anti-Semitic text that he’d found so formative, and I mentioned that I’d just ordered a copy. “Well, don’t red-pill yourself too hard,” he said. Then, after a pause: “You’re not Jewish, are you?”\n\nI am. I don’t put triple parentheses around my name on Twitter, as some Jews do, in defiance of T.R.S.’s Echo. But I have never made a secret of my identity. I have written for Jewish magazines. My face looks Jewish. My name sounds Jewish.\n\n“Yep,” I said.\n\n“Interesting,” he said, sounding a bit flustered. “Fully Jewish, or half Jewish?”\n\n“Fully,” I said. “Your Jewdar must be broken.”\n\n“Yeah, well, you’ve got red hair,” he said. “That threw me.” He encouraged me to read MacDonald’s book nonetheless. “I would hope that you would be able to look past any dissonance and at least examine the argument,” he said. “Maybe do some internal—not that I expect you to hate yourself . . .” He trailed off.\n\nAt one point, without prompting, he said, “You wanna know the first thing my dad asked me after Charlottesville? He didn’t say, ‘Are you O.K.?’ or ‘How are you?’ He said, ‘Change your name.’ ” His birth mother had asked about his safety—“Mothers are mothers,” he explained—but not his father. “He didn’t care about that,” he said. “All he cared about was his _good name_.” I couldn’t be sure, over the phone, but it sounded as if he was holding back tears.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn my last visit to the Peinoviches’ house, Mike, Sr., flipped through a photo album that Billie had brought up from the basement. One photo sparked a pleasant memory: a twenty-fifth-anniversary trip to Hawaii, in 2008, with the three children. “We were all in good spirits that week, even Mike E.,” he said. “We went out to these long dinners and ordered a bunch of cocktails, which probably helped. Mike E. had brought along this computer program he’d made—”\n\n“The Bergman Plot Generator,” Billie said.\n\n“He somehow figured out how to randomly generate plots of Ingmar Bergman films—”\n\n“ ‘A dark knight encounters death on a lonely road,’ that kind of thing—”\n\n“And he left it running, in the condo we were renting, and all day it would be spitting out plots,” Mike, Sr., said, chuckling. “We’d come back inside and read them out to one another, and we’d fall down laughing.”\n\nMike, Sr.,’s smile faded. “I still love him, in spite of everything,” he said, his voice catching. The sun started to set, casting shadows across the living room, and Mike went into the kitchen to open a bottle of wine. Billie said, “All I keep thinking is that, if we were Jewish, we’d be sitting shiva right now.”\n\nAt one point in our conversation, I brought up the Parable of the Prodigal Son, but Mike, Sr., rejected the comparison. A few days later, in an e-mail, he elaborated: “The prodigal son eventually realizes that he would be better off returning to his father as a hired hand than starving as an outcast in a foreign land. His return is an act of self-preservation rather than of repentance. Mike seems to be thriving in his new environment and it’s unlikely he would return to us to save himself.” The parable is a story of unconditional forgiveness, Mike, Sr., wrote. “It’s a very difficult example to live up to.” ♦\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ccc7e716b454591ae1f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mike Enoch (a.k.a.

This year, though, is not your typical year. And so, instead of the usual “best of,” I’ve decided to create a list of classic psychology papers and findings that can explain not just the rise of Donald Trump in the U.S. but also the rising polarization and extremism that seem to have permeated the world. To do this, I solicited the opinion of many leading psychologists, asking them to nominate a paper or two, with a brief explanation for their choice. (Then I nominated some stories myself.) And so, as 2016 draws to a close, here’s a partial collection of the insights that psychology can bring to bear on what the year has brought about, arranged in chronological order.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n**Charles Lord, Lee Ross, and Mark Lepper’s “Biased Assimilation and Attitude Polarization”**\n\n\n\nIn 1979, a team from Stanford University—Charles Lord, Lee Ross, and Mark Lepper—published a [paper](http://nuovoeutile.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIASED-ASSIMILATION-AND-ATTITUDE-POLARIZATION.pdf) that made sense of a common, and seemingly irrational, phenomenon: that the beliefs we hold already affect how we process and assimilate new information. In other words, we don’t learn rationally, taking in information and then making a studied judgment. Instead, the very way we learn is influenced from the onset by what we know and who we are. In the original [study](http://nuovoeutile.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIASED-ASSIMILATION-AND-ATTITUDE-POLARIZATION.pdf), Lord and his colleagues asked people to read a series of studies that seemed to either support or reject the idea that capital punishment deters crime. The participants, it turned out, rated studies confirming their original beliefs as more methodologically rigorous—and those that went against them as shoddy.\n\n\n\nThis process, which is a form of what’s called confirmation bias, can help explain why Trump supporters remain supportive no matter what evidence one puts to them—and why Trump’s opponents are unlikely to be convinced of his worth even if he ends up doing something actually positive. The two groups simply process information differently. “The confirmation bias is not specific to Donald Trump. It’s something we are all susceptible to,” the Columbia University psychologist Daniel Ames, one of several scholars to nominate this paper, said. “But Trump appears to be an especially public and risky illustration of it in many domains.” (Ames and his colleague Alice Lee [recently](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115000529) showed a similar effect with beliefs about torture.)\n\n\n\nA closely related [paper](http://ssc.wisc.edu/~jpiliavi/965/hwang.pdf) by Ross, Lepper, and Robert Vallone, from 1985, found that the polarization effect was particularly powerful among strong partisans. When looking at perceptions of the 1982 Beirut massacre, they found that more extreme partisans saw the facts as more biased, and recalled the media coverage of the massacre differently. They saw more negative references to their side, and they predicted that nonpartisans would be swayed more negatively against them as a result—thus increasing their perception of being assaulted and solidifying their opinions. The more knowledge of the issue they had, the greater their perception of bias. American politics has grown only more partisan since the eighties, and this finding can help explain some of the backlash among Trump supporters to press outlets that reported critically on him.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Dan Kahan’s “Cultural Cognition”**\n\n\n\nOver the last [decade](http://www.culturalcognition.net/dan-kahans-publications/), Dan Kahan, a psychologist at Yale University, has been studying a phenomenon he calls “cultural cognition,” or how values shape perception of risk and policy beliefs. One of his insights is that people often engage in something called “identity-protective cognition.” They process information in a way that protects their idea of themselves. Incongruous information is discarded, and supporting information is eagerly retained. Our memory actually ends up skewed: we are better able to process and recall the facts that we are motivated to process and recall, while conveniently forgetting those that we would prefer weren’t true. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, one of several to nominate Kahan for this list, said that his theory is best called “political and intellectual tribalism.” Like seeks like, and like affirms like—and people gravitate to the intellectually similar others, even when all of their actions should rightly set off alarm bells.\n\n\n\nTrump, Pinker said, won over pretty much the entire Republican Party, and all those who felt alienated from the left, by declaring himself to be opposed to the “establishment” and political correctness. And this all happened, Pinker wrote to me, “despite his obvious temperamental unsuitability for the responsibilities of the Presidency, his opposition to free trade and open borders (which should have, but did not, poison him with the libertarian right), his libertine and irreligious lifestyle (which should have, but did not, poison him with evangelicals), his sympathies with Putin’s Russia (which should have, but did not, poison him with patriots), and his hostility to American military and political alliances with democracies (which should have, but did not, poison him with neoconservatives).”\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Karen Stenner’s “The Authoritarian Dynamic”**\n\n\n\n[Research](https://www.amazon.com/Authoritarian-Dynamic-Cambridge-Political-Psychology/dp/052153478X) published a decade ago by Karen Stenner provides insight into a psychological trait known as authoritarianism: the desire for strong order and control. Most people aren’t authoritarian as such, Stenner finds. Instead, most of us are usually capable of fairly high tolerance. It’s only when we feel we are under threat—especially what Stenner calls “normative threat,” or a threat to the perceived integrity of the moral order—that we suddenly shut down our openness and begin to ask for greater force and authoritarian power. People want to protect their way of life, and when they think it’s in danger they start grasping for more extreme-seeming alternatives. In 2005, Stenner offered a prediction that seems clairvoyant now. In response to the increasing tolerance in Western societies, she wrote, an authoritarian backlash was all but inevitable:\n\n> \n> \n> [T]he increasing license allowed by those evolving cultures generates the very conditions guaranteed to goad latent authoritarians to sudden and intense, perhaps violent, and almost certainly unexpected, expressions of intolerance. . . . The kind of intolerance that springs from aberrant individual psychology, rather than the disinterested absorption of pervasive cultural norms, is bound to be more passionate and irrational, less predictable, less amenable to persuasion, and more aggravated than educated by the cultural promotion of tolerance.\n> \n> \n> \n>  \n\n\n\n**John Tooby and Leda Cosmide’s “Groups in Mind: The Coalitional Roots of War and Morality”**\n\n\n\nIn 2010, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, scholars at the University of California, Santa Barbara, best known for their work in evolutionary psychology, published a [paper](http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/GroupsInMind2010.pdf) on the use of outrage to help mobilize coalitions. Their main claim is that humans, like other animals, are predisposed to coalition-building: in order to best protect ourselves, we coöperate with those we see as within our coalition, and we fight those we see as outside it. One of the ways coalitions can be galvanized to action, the authors showed, is by uniting them against a perceived outrage—and this dynamic played out repeatedly in the Trump campaign, both with Trump supporters and the opposition. Play up the outrage factor and suddenly groups bond together like never before—and prepare to attack like never before.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Michele Gelfand’s “Cultural Tightness”**\n\n\n\nIn a series of recent papers in [_Science_](http://www.gelfand.umd.edu/papers/Gelfand%202011%20ScienceMag.pdf) and [_PNAS_](http://www.gelfand.umd.edu/papers/Harrington%20Gelfand%20PNAS.pdf), Michele Gelfand, a psychologist at the University of Maryland, demonstrated a concept that seems particularly relevant not only to Trump but to the seeming polarization of politics more globally: in surveys conducted throughout the United States, in one case, and in thirty-three countries, in another, combined with historical analyses and personality assessments, she found that when people perceive higher threat levels and are under stress, they flock to leaders who promise tighter rules, greater strength, a more authoritarian approach. Gelfand calls this “cultural tightness”: a desire for strong social norms and a low tolerance for any sort of deviant behavior. As threat perception increases, even looser cultures—those with high tolerance and lower norms—begin to tighten up.\n\n\n\nThroughout the election, Trump himself stoked the feeling of threat and fear, so that he became a seemingly more and more fitting leader. [In Europe](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-europe-of-donald-trumps), rhetoric about terrorism, immigration threats, and the like is doing much the same thing. The greater the perceived threat, the tighter the culture becomes. Indeed, Gelfand [has found](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-culture-threat-fear-and-the-tightening-of-the-american-mind/) that the strongest supporters of Trump were also those who thought the U.S. was under the greatest threat.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Tali Sharot’s “Optimism Bias”**\n\n\n\nSo why didn’t anyone see this coming and try to reverse any of the trends? In [ongoing research](http://affectivebrain.com/?page_id=161), the psychologist Tali Sharot is investigating something known as “optimism bias”: we think the future is going to be better than the past. We tend to dismiss things we don’t particularly like, or that we find disturbing, as aberrations. Instead, we assume that the future will be far more promising than current signs might make it seem. We are, in a sense, hardwired for hope. And so that’s what we do. Until the very end, some supporters of Hillary Clinton held out hope that the Electoral College would somehow, for the first time in history, reverse the results of the election, just as some people had held out hope that Trump wouldn’t get the G.O.P. nomination and, once he did, that he wouldn’t accept it.

It explicitly legalizes discrimination if it is motivated by one\nof three beliefs: that marriage is a union between one man and one\nwoman, that sexual relations can take place only within such a marriage,\nand that gender is an immutable biological characteristic. The law was\npassed last year and immediately blocked by a federal judge, but last\nweek a circuit court reversed the ruling. Doctors, lawyers, and adoption\nagencies, among others, are now licensed to discriminate on the basis of\nsexual and gender identity.\n\nMississippi’s is the harshest of a recent wave of so-called\nreligious-freedom laws; its enactment is only the latest blow to the\nrights of L.G.B.T. Americans in what has felt like a year of injuries.\nIn February, the Trump Administration rescinded protections allowing\ntransgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. In May,\nPresident Trump signed an [executive\norder](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/04/presidential-executive-order-promoting-free-speech-and-religious-liberty) directing his Attorney General to support and defend religious-freedom\nlaws like the one in Mississippi. In July, Trump tweeted out a [ban on\ntransgender service members](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-cruelty-and-cynicism-of-trumps-transgender-military-ban). In September, the Justice Department filed\na Supreme Court brief in support of a Colorado baker who refused to make\na cake for a same-sex wedding. This month, Attorney General Jeff\nSessions issued detailed\n[guidelines](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1001891/download?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) based on Trump’s religious-freedom executive order and, separately,\n[instructed](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4067437-Sessions-memo-reversing-gender-identity-civil.html) U.S. Attorneys to stop interpreting federal law as protecting\ntransgender employees from discrimination on the basis of sex. This\ntimeline is probably missing something; reversals in L.G.B.T. rights\nhave been unremitting.\n\nLess than a year ago—one week before the election—Trump [unfurled a\nrainbow\nflag](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-donald-trump-unfurled-an-upside-down-rainbow-flag-onstage_us_58189a60e4b0990edc336c51),\nalbeit upside down, during a rally in Colorado. Someone had scribbled\nthe words “LGBTs for Trump” on it. For much of his campaign,\nconventional wisdom held that Trump, the secular New Yorker that he is,\nwould not pursue the anti-gay policies that his early supporter Sessions\nor his Vice-Presidential pick, Mike Pence, would advocate. But a\nstrategy of homophobia has proved irresistible to Trump—and not just\nbecause of Pence and Sessions and the backing of the evangelical right.\n(“So many of them support what I do. They support me from the\nevangelical-Christian standpoint,” the President said in an interview\nlast weekend with Mike Huckabee.)\n\nIn the nostalgic campaign that got him elected, Trump promised to take\nhis voters back to an imaginary past in which they felt better, more\nsecure, and generally more great than they do in the present. Nothing\ncommunicates Trump’s commitment to the past as effectively as reversals\nof L.G.B.T. civil-rights progress—arguably the most rapid social change\nin American history. Supreme Court decisions in 2013 and 2015 granting equal status to same-sex marriages were rightly framed as breakthroughs: they had seemed nearly inconceivable just a few years earlier, a fantasy for some\nand a nightmare for others. It was inconceivable, too, that a Republican\nnominee for President would drape himself in a rainbow flag. The beliefs\nthat the Mississippi law frames as religious—that marriage is a straight\ninstitution, that all people are born male or female and stay that\nway—are, in fact, many Americans’ intuition of the way things always\nwere and should be. The appeal of anti-queer gestures goes beyond the\nhard evangelical right, and probably includes some people whose best\nfriends are gay.\n\nThe appeal can get broader still. Several of the ongoing or upcoming\nL.G.B.T.-rights battles will concern children. They always do: anyone\nwho has studied the history of homophobic campaigns, or lived through\none, knows that, in the end, it’s always about the children. Indeed,\n“Protect the Children” is the battle cry of xenophobes of all stripes,\nbut this call carries particular potency in matters of sex and gender.\n\nGoing back forty years, the first backlash effort against the gay\nmovement in this country—Anita Bryant’s “Save Our Children” campaign,\nwhich began in 1977 to oppose an anti-discrimination ordinance in\nMiami—trafficked in images of homosexual recruitment and child\nmolestation. A decade later, following a campaign of panic centered on\nschool materials and children’s books, the British Parliament banned\nlocal governments in England, Wales, and Scotland from “promoting\nhomosexuality.” (Known as Section 28, the ban was repealed in 2003.)\nRussia’s 2013 ban on “homosexual propaganda” followed a prolonged\ncampaign against the imaginary threat of pedophilia and homosexual\nrecruitment. A week after the propaganda ban, Russia passed a law\nbanning same-sex couples from adopting children. I had to leave the\ncountry to protect my adopted son from state-appointed protectors. Those\nwho lingered have fared worse: last month, for example, social services\nin the city of Yekaterinburg revoked the guardianship of two children\nbecause their mother had undergone top surgery and was blogging about\ntransitioning.\n\nIn the U.S., if a state with a religious-freedom law contracts out the\nplacement of adoptive and foster children to private agencies,\nplacements with L.G.B.T. families tend to dry up—because the agencies\noften hold a religious affiliation. Last month, the A.C.L.U. [filed\nsuit](https://www.aclu.org/blog/lgbt-rights/lgbt-parenting/same-sex-couples-are-being-turned-away-becoming-foster-and-adoptive) against the state of Michigan for turning away prospective adoptive and\nfoster parents because of their sexual orientation. If the Mississippi\nlaw is challenged again, the case will also likely concern adoption or\nfoster placement. A proposed religious-freedom [bill](https://secure-web.cisco.com/1DO6vKvmv3FO2zqdgKgT0L_vCfObxLtybqVPqiUPpqEVAKYRvgSnZ65K14yYr6YIejEWV1j3aWJop5AmXEHE7I4aXrVLGOw7Q-4WJ3C-d8n-1a77RDaDsKIOQ98hJc4Sbcm_9NgXNOs5z7WXPkiFfBVeglQrklmpdqi7RvOjeX9gaVyOccJJBU_hpCUEv1JFyuQyNSTybfrHyr5VKoRTsyNSKHL8aIqimi7Cv2OklMKu2Kv3VFC2fxZQ1ZJFtlSMGfylbQXHmhHPYh0etLHPmVW5KByDylayTZizkSz4bs8r_aDtX9q--7mPAazwbWKhA/https://legiscan.com/OK/text/HB1507/id/1467410) in Oklahoma solely concerns child-placement agencies. Another kind of case concerns transgender high-school students’ right to use the bathrooms of their choice. A federal appeals\ncourt recently decided a Wisconsin case in favor of a transgender\nstudent, while a different appeals court must review a well-publicized\nNorth Carolina case, now that the Trump Administration has reversed\ncourse and the [Supreme Court declined to hear the case](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-phase-of-chaos-on-transgender-rights).\n\nIt seems both inevitable and ominous that the re-litigation of L.G.B.T.\nrights will center on children. Much of the success of the American\nL.G.B.T. movement in the last couple of decades has turned on avoiding\nconfrontation with the perception of the homosexual threat to children.\nThe strategy has been either to desexualize gays by shifting the\nconversation to marriage and parenting or—brilliantly—to position\ntransgender children as the ones in need of protection. As a result,\nadvances in L.G.B.T. rights have occurred despite a parallel trend\ntoward ever more policing of sex and an intensifying drive for the\nprotection of children from nearly everything.\n\nThe era of Trumpian reversal is expressed in terms of religious belief\nbut driven by the desire to see children grow up in a world that their\nparents understand. With the rhetoric of “religious freedom” ramping up,\nthe strategic decoupling of gays from children will no longer hold. It’s\ngoing to get ugly.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c962bfcc72cd92d054d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gay Rights","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gay-rights"},{"id":"5c2e1c7722d4972cd5b83288","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"L.G.B.T.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lgbt"},{"id":"5c2e1ccf7e716b454591ae25","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Religious Freedom","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"religious-freedom"},{"id":"5c2e1c964a08312cd3aa6c63","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"LGBTQ","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lgbtq"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

This year, though, is not your typical year. And so, instead of the usual “best of,” I’ve decided to create a list of classic psychology papers and findings that can explain not just the rise of Donald Trump in the U.S. but also the rising polarization and extremism that seem to have permeated the world. To do this, I solicited the opinion of many leading psychologists, asking them to nominate a paper or two, with a brief explanation for their choice. (Then I nominated some stories myself.) And so, as 2016 draws to a close, here’s a partial collection of the insights that psychology can bring to bear on what the year has brought about, arranged in chronological order.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n**Charles Lord, Lee Ross, and Mark Lepper’s “Biased Assimilation and Attitude Polarization”**\n\n\n\nIn 1979, a team from Stanford University—Charles Lord, Lee Ross, and Mark Lepper—published a [paper](http://nuovoeutile.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIASED-ASSIMILATION-AND-ATTITUDE-POLARIZATION.pdf) that made sense of a common, and seemingly irrational, phenomenon: that the beliefs we hold already affect how we process and assimilate new information. In other words, we don’t learn rationally, taking in information and then making a studied judgment. Instead, the very way we learn is influenced from the onset by what we know and who we are. In the original [study](http://nuovoeutile.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIASED-ASSIMILATION-AND-ATTITUDE-POLARIZATION.pdf), Lord and his colleagues asked people to read a series of studies that seemed to either support or reject the idea that capital punishment deters crime. The participants, it turned out, rated studies confirming their original beliefs as more methodologically rigorous—and those that went against them as shoddy.\n\n\n\nThis process, which is a form of what’s called confirmation bias, can help explain why Trump supporters remain supportive no matter what evidence one puts to them—and why Trump’s opponents are unlikely to be convinced of his worth even if he ends up doing something actually positive. The two groups simply process information differently. “The confirmation bias is not specific to Donald Trump. It’s something we are all susceptible to,” the Columbia University psychologist Daniel Ames, one of several scholars to nominate this paper, said. “But Trump appears to be an especially public and risky illustration of it in many domains.” (Ames and his colleague Alice Lee [recently](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115000529) showed a similar effect with beliefs about torture.)\n\n\n\nA closely related [paper](http://ssc.wisc.edu/~jpiliavi/965/hwang.pdf) by Ross, Lepper, and Robert Vallone, from 1985, found that the polarization effect was particularly powerful among strong partisans. When looking at perceptions of the 1982 Beirut massacre, they found that more extreme partisans saw the facts as more biased, and recalled the media coverage of the massacre differently. They saw more negative references to their side, and they predicted that nonpartisans would be swayed more negatively against them as a result—thus increasing their perception of being assaulted and solidifying their opinions. The more knowledge of the issue they had, the greater their perception of bias. American politics has grown only more partisan since the eighties, and this finding can help explain some of the backlash among Trump supporters to press outlets that reported critically on him.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Dan Kahan’s “Cultural Cognition”**\n\n\n\nOver the last [decade](http://www.culturalcognition.net/dan-kahans-publications/), Dan Kahan, a psychologist at Yale University, has been studying a phenomenon he calls “cultural cognition,” or how values shape perception of risk and policy beliefs. One of his insights is that people often engage in something called “identity-protective cognition.” They process information in a way that protects their idea of themselves. Incongruous information is discarded, and supporting information is eagerly retained. Our memory actually ends up skewed: we are better able to process and recall the facts that we are motivated to process and recall, while conveniently forgetting those that we would prefer weren’t true. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, one of several to nominate Kahan for this list, said that his theory is best called “political and intellectual tribalism.” Like seeks like, and like affirms like—and people gravitate to the intellectually similar others, even when all of their actions should rightly set off alarm bells.\n\n\n\nTrump, Pinker said, won over pretty much the entire Republican Party, and all those who felt alienated from the left, by declaring himself to be opposed to the “establishment” and political correctness. And this all happened, Pinker wrote to me, “despite his obvious temperamental unsuitability for the responsibilities of the Presidency, his opposition to free trade and open borders (which should have, but did not, poison him with the libertarian right), his libertine and irreligious lifestyle (which should have, but did not, poison him with evangelicals), his sympathies with Putin’s Russia (which should have, but did not, poison him with patriots), and his hostility to American military and political alliances with democracies (which should have, but did not, poison him with neoconservatives).”\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Karen Stenner’s “The Authoritarian Dynamic”**\n\n\n\n[Research](https://www.amazon.com/Authoritarian-Dynamic-Cambridge-Political-Psychology/dp/052153478X) published a decade ago by Karen Stenner provides insight into a psychological trait known as authoritarianism: the desire for strong order and control. Most people aren’t authoritarian as such, Stenner finds. Instead, most of us are usually capable of fairly high tolerance. It’s only when we feel we are under threat—especially what Stenner calls “normative threat,” or a threat to the perceived integrity of the moral order—that we suddenly shut down our openness and begin to ask for greater force and authoritarian power. People want to protect their way of life, and when they think it’s in danger they start grasping for more extreme-seeming alternatives. In 2005, Stenner offered a prediction that seems clairvoyant now. In response to the increasing tolerance in Western societies, she wrote, an authoritarian backlash was all but inevitable:\n\n> \n> \n> [T]he increasing license allowed by those evolving cultures generates the very conditions guaranteed to goad latent authoritarians to sudden and intense, perhaps violent, and almost certainly unexpected, expressions of intolerance. . . . The kind of intolerance that springs from aberrant individual psychology, rather than the disinterested absorption of pervasive cultural norms, is bound to be more passionate and irrational, less predictable, less amenable to persuasion, and more aggravated than educated by the cultural promotion of tolerance.\n> \n> \n> \n>  \n\n\n\n**John Tooby and Leda Cosmide’s “Groups in Mind: The Coalitional Roots of War and Morality”**\n\n\n\nIn 2010, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, scholars at the University of California, Santa Barbara, best known for their work in evolutionary psychology, published a [paper](http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/GroupsInMind2010.pdf) on the use of outrage to help mobilize coalitions. Their main claim is that humans, like other animals, are predisposed to coalition-building: in order to best protect ourselves, we coöperate with those we see as within our coalition, and we fight those we see as outside it. One of the ways coalitions can be galvanized to action, the authors showed, is by uniting them against a perceived outrage—and this dynamic played out repeatedly in the Trump campaign, both with Trump supporters and the opposition. Play up the outrage factor and suddenly groups bond together like never before—and prepare to attack like never before.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Michele Gelfand’s “Cultural Tightness”**\n\n\n\nIn a series of recent papers in [_Science_](http://www.gelfand.umd.edu/papers/Gelfand%202011%20ScienceMag.pdf) and [_PNAS_](http://www.gelfand.umd.edu/papers/Harrington%20Gelfand%20PNAS.pdf), Michele Gelfand, a psychologist at the University of Maryland, demonstrated a concept that seems particularly relevant not only to Trump but to the seeming polarization of politics more globally: in surveys conducted throughout the United States, in one case, and in thirty-three countries, in another, combined with historical analyses and personality assessments, she found that when people perceive higher threat levels and are under stress, they flock to leaders who promise tighter rules, greater strength, a more authoritarian approach. Gelfand calls this “cultural tightness”: a desire for strong social norms and a low tolerance for any sort of deviant behavior. As threat perception increases, even looser cultures—those with high tolerance and lower norms—begin to tighten up.\n\n\n\nThroughout the election, Trump himself stoked the feeling of threat and fear, so that he became a seemingly more and more fitting leader. [In Europe](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-europe-of-donald-trumps), rhetoric about terrorism, immigration threats, and the like is doing much the same thing. The greater the perceived threat, the tighter the culture becomes. Indeed, Gelfand [has found](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-culture-threat-fear-and-the-tightening-of-the-american-mind/) that the strongest supporters of Trump were also those who thought the U.S. was under the greatest threat.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Tali Sharot’s “Optimism Bias”**\n\n\n\nSo why didn’t anyone see this coming and try to reverse any of the trends? In [ongoing research](http://affectivebrain.com/?page_id=161), the psychologist Tali Sharot is investigating something known as “optimism bias”: we think the future is going to be better than the past. We tend to dismiss things we don’t particularly like, or that we find disturbing, as aberrations. Instead, we assume that the future will be far more promising than current signs might make it seem. We are, in a sense, hardwired for hope. And so that’s what we do. Until the very end, some supporters of Hillary Clinton held out hope that the Electoral College would somehow, for the first time in history, reverse the results of the election, just as some people had held out hope that Trump wouldn’t get the G.O.P. nomination and, once he did, that he wouldn’t accept it. Now many Trump opponents hold out hope that once he assumes office he will act differently than he has on the campaign trail. People keep hoping for the best, even in the face of great odds. And it’s a hope that helps us survive, even when those great odds defy us.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/the-psychological-research-that-helps-explain-the-election","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Psychology","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5c2e1c9b2396212cbb9fc9c9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c9b2396212cbb9fc9c9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Research","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"research"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Research","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"research"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"},{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

The polls strongly suggested that Hillary Clinton would win. I had brought my infant son, and I took a selfie so that one day I could show him that he’d been present for this historic occasion. Crowds of people flocked to Susan B. Anthony’s grave and placed flowers on it. My childhood best friend and I spoke and celebrated the more equal world we were about to live in. Clinton's campaign was stationed at the Javits Center, with its high glass ceiling, and I imagined that I felt its shards at my feet as I walked. And then, suddenly, it was Wednesday morning, and I was gathering with friends for coffee because none of us wanted to be alone. “We need to sit shiva,” one said. Another e-mailed, “Losing this election feels like a death of sorts—the loss of a future.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are experiencing not just the pain of political defeat but the grief of mourning something that feels irrevocably lost. There are two losses here, complementing and intensifying each other. First, the shocking defeat of Clinton, and the evaporation of a future in which a woman was the leader of the free world. Her defeat was a visceral reminder that misogyny and unconscious bias remain powerful forces. As psychologists note, after a death we mourn not only the deceased but also the version of ourselves we got to be with that person. What makes Clinton's defeat unique, I think, is that we’re grieving for the nation we could have been, a nation some of us feel we _are__:_ a nation that elected a female President and rejected the rhetoric of nativism and fear that Donald Trump so casually embraced.\n\n\n\nThe second loss is the surreal election of a bigot like Trump. It brings with it a version of what psychologists call anticipatory grief—the emotion we feel while taking care of someone with a terminal illness and waiting for the worst to come. What faces America may not be a death, but it’s not an overstatement to say that people on both the left and the right fear that Trump is capable of destroying our democracy. Trump’s erratic vitriol, his capriciousness, his ignorance and lack of curiosity about foreign affairs have made him seem uniquely dangerous. On the eve of the election, Trump’s aides reportedly took away his Twitter account, leading President Obama to mockingly—but seriously!—proclaim, “Now, if somebody can’t handle a Twitter account, they can’t handle the nuclear codes.”\n\n\n\nCertainly, Trump is capable of derailing or rescinding many achievements that Obama and others fought and hoped for: universal health care, the Paris accord, a liberal-leaning Supreme Court. What’s even scarier, though, is that he is an unknown quantity. As the conservative columnist Ross Douthat put it on the night of Trump’s election, “I fear the risks of a Trump presidency as I have feared nothing in our politics before.” After all, Douthat noted, this is “a man more likely to fail catastrophically than other presidents.” And so we wait, in the state of anxiety and dread that anticipatory mourning brings with it: unsure of what is to come, fearing the worst.\n\n\n\nWhat lies before us is a kind of coming to terms with reality that resembles the work of mourning. “After great pain, a formal feeling comes,” Emily Dickinson wrote, describing the numb shock and dissociation experienced after a death. On Election Night, I felt a kind of heavy sorrow and dread I hadn’t felt since the day I found out my mother had metastatic cancer. Mourning happens slowly and incompletely, as we try to come to terms with a sudden absence. In this election, because the division between the candidates was so stark, many of the liberal élite are asking themselves what they missed, how this could be. It feels tragic that we as a nation could have arrived at such different conclusions—not just different but _irreconcilable_. In addition to the alt-right and the fringe racists shouting “_Sieg heil!__”_ at Trump’s rallies, there are Americans in need of political change who genuinely felt that Trump represented their best chance. And how do you speak across the bridge to them when Trump seems, to so many of us, not just undesirable but actually unimaginable?\n\n\n\nAs acute as the grief over Clinton's loss now is, it is the long mourning of Trump’s Presidency that may be worse. Uncertainty and volatility are difficult to deal with. Even the think pieces perversely noting that Trump’s supporters are about to reap what they sowed, potentially driving some of them back to the Democrats, are no consolation. All we can do is grapple with the new reality, one foot still in the ghost world that might have been. We should remember, though, one meaningful difference between grief over a death and grief over an election loss: this week, we are mourning a ghost world that _can_ be conjured back to life.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/mourning-trump-and-the-america-we-could-have-been","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1cc24a08312cd3aa6c9e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Grief","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"grief"},{"id":"5c2e1c8aee7fe02cbd16334d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hillary Clinton","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hillary-clinton"},{"id":"5c2e1cdb81ab3335f580f1dd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mourning","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mourning"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a03d2fba4e90c8d8d92c9","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/meghan-orourke","email":"","name":"Meghan O’Rourke","socialMedia":[],"title":"Meghan O’Rourke, a former editor at the magazine, is the author of the poetry collections “Halflife” and “Once,” and the memoir “The Long Goodbye.”"}]},"dek":"","hed":"Mourning Trump and the America We Could Have Been","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2017-06-19T18:08:24.070Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"59097bc1ebe912338a378704","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1333,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2017/05/03/59097bc1ebe912338a378703_MontgomeryElectionNight-018.jpg"}},"caption":"Hillary Clinton’s supporters at the Javits Center, where the campaign was stationed on Election Night.","altText":"Hillary Clinton’s supporters at the Javits Center, where the campaign was stationed on Election Night.","credit":"Photograph by Philip Montgomery for The New Yorker","filename":"MontgomeryElectionNight-018.jpg","revision":3,"title":"montgomeryelectionnight-018","notes":"_wordpress_id:3279544","variants":{}}]},"promoDek":"","promoHed":"","pubDate":"2016-11-10T21:49:26.000Z","related":[],"rubric":"","seoDescription":"Meghan O’Rourke on mourning the two losses of the election: the defeat of Hillary Clinton, and the election of Donald Trump as President.","seoTitle":"Mourning Trump and the America We Could Have Been","socialDescription":"We’re not just experiencing the pain of political defeat but grieving over something that feels irrevocably lost.","socialTitle":"Mourning Trump and the America We Could Have Been","subChannel":"","tags":["2016 election","Donald Trump","Grief","Hillary Clinton","Mourning","_wordpress_id:3279534"],"template":"standard","url":"/culture/culture-desk/mourning-trump-and-the-america-we-could-have-been","videos":{}},{"id":"5911ca5b1e0bd81131e7d317","modelName":"article","collection":"articles","body":"## He Appears\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nTrump is wearing the red baseball cap, or not. From this distance, he is strangely handsome, well proportioned, puts you in mind of a sea captain: Alan Hale from “Gilligan’s Island,” say, had Hale been slimmer, richer, more self-confident. We are afforded a side view of a head of silver-yellow hair and a hawklike orange-red face, the cheeks of which, if stared at steadily enough, will seem, through some optical illusion, to glow orange-redder at moments when the crowd is especially pleased. If you’ve ever, watching “The Apprentice,” entertained fantasies of how you might fare in the boardroom (the Donald, recognizing your excellent qualities with his professional businessman’s acumen, does not fire you but, on the contrary, pulls you aside to assign you some important non-TV, real-world mission), you may, for a brief, embarrassing instant, as he scans the crowd, expect him to recognize you.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is blessing us here in San Jose, California, with his celebrity, promising never to disappoint us, letting us in on the latest bit of inside-baseball campaign strategy: “Lyin’ Ted” is no longer to be Lyin’ Ted; henceforth he will be just “Ted.” Hillary, however, shall be “Lyin’ Crooked.” And, by the way, Hillary has to go to jail. The statute of limitations is five years, and if he gets elected in November, well . . . The crowd sends forth a coarse blood roar. “She’s guilty as hell,” he snarls.\n\n\n\nHe growls, rants, shouts, digresses, careens from shtick nugget to shtick nugget, rhapsodizes over past landslides, name-drops Ivanka, Melania, Mike Tyson, Newt Gingrich, Bobby Knight, Bill O’Reilly. His right shoulder thrusts out as he makes the pinched-finger mudra with downswinging arm. His trademark double-eye squint evokes that group of beanie-hatted street-tough Munchkin kids; you expect him to kick gruffly at an imaginary stone. In person, his autocratic streak is presentationally complicated by a Ralph Kramdenesque vulnerability. He’s a man who has just dropped a can opener into his wife’s freshly baked pie. He’s not about to start grovelling about it, and yet he’s sorry—but, come on, it was an _accident_. He’s sorry, he’s sorry, O.K., but do you expect him to _say it_? He’s a good guy. Anyway, he didn’t do it.\n\n\n\nOnce, Jack Benny, whose character was known for frugality and selfishness, got a huge laugh by glancing down at the baseball he was supposed to be first-pitching, pocketing it, and walking off the field. Trump, similarly, knows how well we know him from TV. He is who he is. So sue me, O.K.? I probably shouldn’t say this, but oops—just did. (Hillary’s attack ads? “_So_ false. Ah, some of them aren’t that false, actually.”) It’s oddly riveting, watching someone take such pleasure in going so much farther out on thin ice than anyone else as famous would dare to go. His crowds are ever hopeful for the next thrilling rude swerve. “There could be no politics which gave warmth to one’s body until the country had recovered its imagination, its pioneer lust for the unexpected and incalculable,” Norman Mailer wrote in 1960.\n\n\n\nThe speeches themselves are nearly all empty assertion. Assertion and bragging. Assertion, bragging, and defensiveness. He is always boasting about the size of this crowd or that crowd, refuting some slight from someone who has treated him “very unfairly,” underscoring his sincerity via adjectival pile-on (he’s “going to appoint beautiful, incredible, unbelievable Supreme Court Justices”). He lies, bullies, menaces, dishes it out but can’t seem to take it, exhibits such a muddy understanding of certain American principles (the press is free, torture illegal, criticism and libel two different things) that he might be a seventeenth-century Austrian prince time-transported here to mess with us. Sometimes it seems that he truly does not give a shit, and you imagine his minders cringing backstage. Other times you imagine them bored, checking their phones, convinced that nothing will ever touch him. Increasingly, his wild veering seems to occur against his will, as if he were not the great, sly strategist we have taken him for but, rather, someone compelled by an inner music that sometimes produces good dancing and sometimes causes him to bring a bookshelf crashing down on an old Mexican lady. _Get more_, that inner music seems to be telling him. _Get_, _finally_, _enough. Refute a lifetime of critics. Create a pile of unprecedented testimonials_, _attendance receipts_, _polling numbers_, _and pundit gasps that will_, _once and for all_, _prove—what_?\n\n\n\nApply Occam’s razor: if someone brags this much, bending every ray of light back to himself, what’s the simplest explanation?\n\n\n\n“We’re on the cover of every newspaper, every magazine,” he says in San Jose in early June. “_Time_ magazine many times. I just learned they’re doing yet another cover on Trump—I love that. You know, _Time_ magazine’s a good magazine. You grow up reading _Time_ magazine—who ever thought you’d be on the cover of _Time_ magazine? Especially so much?”\n\n\n\nIt’s considered an indication of authenticity that he doesn’t generally speak from a teleprompter but just wings it. (In fact, he brings to the podium a few pages of handwritten bullet points, to which he periodically refers as he, mostly, wings it.) He wings it because winging it serves his purpose. He is not trying to persuade, detail, or prove: he is trying to thrill, agitate, be liked, be loved, here and now. He is trying to make energy. (At one point in his San Jose speech, he endearingly fumbles with a sheaf of “statistics,” reads a few, fondly but slightingly mentions the loyal, hapless statistician who compiled them, then seems unable to go on, afraid he might be boring us.) \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b66dbf60db474ba953c9b]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nAnd make energy he does. It flows out of him, as if channelled in thousands of micro wires, enters the minds of his followers: their cheers go ragged and hoarse, chanting erupts, a look of religious zeal may flash across the face of some non-chanter, who is finally getting, in response to a question long nursed in private, exactly the answer he’s been craving. One such person stays in my memory from a rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona, in March: a solidly built man in his mid-forties, wearing, in the crazy heat, a long-sleeved black shirt, who, as Trump spoke, worked himself into a state of riveted, silent concentration-fury, the rally equivalent of someone at church gazing fixedly down at the pew before him, nodding, Yes, yes, yes.\n\n## A Tiny Pissed Voice Rings Out \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n“Wow, what a crowd this is,” he begins at Fountain Hills. “What a great honor! . . . You have some sheriff—there’s no games with your sheriff, that’s for sure. . . . We have a movement going on, folks. . . . I will never let you down! Remember. And I want to tell you, you know, it’s so much about illegal immigration and so much has been mentioned about it and talked about it, and these politicians are all talk, no action. They’re never going to do anything—they only picked it up because when I went, and when I announced, that I’m running for President, I said, ‘You know, this country has a big, big problem with illegal immigration,’ and all of a sudden we started talking about it. . . . And there was crime and you had so many killings and so much crime, drugs were pouring through the border.” (“*STOP IT*{: .small}!” someone pleads from the crowd.) “People are now seeing it. And you know what? We’re going to build a wall and we are going to stop it!”\n\n\n\n\n\nMayhem. The Wall is their favorite. (Earlier in the afternoon, Jan Brewer, the former governor of Arizona and legislative mother of that state’s Draconian immigration policies, nearly undoes all the good right-wing work of her career by affirming that, yes, Trump is “going to build _the Fence_.” Like new Americans who have just been told that Hulk Hogan was the first President, the crowd rises up in happy outrage to correct her.)\n\n\n\n“*THANK YOU, TRUMP*{: .small}!” bellows a kid in front of me, who, later in the speech, will briefly turn his back on Trump to take a Trump-including selfie, his smile taut, braces-revealing, grimacelike yet celebratory, evoking that circa-1950 photograph of a man in a high-velocity wind tunnel.\n\n\n\n“I only wish these cameras—because there’s nothing as dishonest as the media, that I can tell you.” (“*THEY SUCK*{: .small}!”) “I only wish these cameramen would spin around and show the kind of people that we have, the numbers of people that we have here. I just wish they’d for once do it, because you know what?” (“*PAN THE CAMERAS*{: .small}!”) “We have a silent majority that’s no longer so silent. It’s now the loud, noisy majority, and we’re going to be heard. . . . They’re chipping away at the Second Amendment, they’re chipping away at Christianity. . . . We’re not going to have it anymore. It comes Christmas time, we’re going to see signs up that say ‘Merry Merry Merry Christmas!’ O.K.? Remember it, remember it. We have become so politically correct that we’re totally impotent as a country—”\n\n\n\nSomewhere in the crowd, a woman is shouting “Fuck you, Trump!” in a voice so thin it seems to be emanating from some distant neighborhood, where a girl is calling home her brother, Fuckhugh Trump.\n\n\n\nThe shouter is Esperanza Matamoros, tiny, seventeen years old. The crowd now halts her forward progress, so she judiciously spins and, still shouting, heads toward the exit. As she passes a tall, white-haired, professorial-looking old man, he gives her a little shove. He towers over her, the top of her head falling below his armpit. She could be his daughter, his granddaughter, his favorite student. Another man steps in front of her to deliver an impromptu manners lesson; apparently, she bumped him on her way up. “_Excuse me_,” he says heatedly. “Around here, we say _excuse me_.”\n\n\n\nAn ungentleness gets into the air when Trump speaks, prompting the abandonment of certain social norms (e.g., an old man should show forbearance and physical respect for a young woman, even—especially—an angry young woman, and might even think to wonder what is making her so angry), norms that, to fired-up Trump supporters, must feel antiquated in this brave new moment of ideological foment. They have thought and thought, in projective terms, about theoretical protesters, and now here are some real ones.\n\n\n\nThis ungentleness ripples out through the crowd and into the area beyond the fence where the protesters have set up shop. One of them, Sandra Borchers, tells me that out there all was calm (she was “actually having dialogues” with Trump supporters, “back-and-forth conversations, at about this talking level”) until Trump started speaking. Then things got “violent and aggressive.” Someone threw a rock at her head. A female Trump supporter “in a pink-peachy-color T-shirt” attacked a protester, kicking and punching him. Rebecca LaStrap, an African-American woman, twenty years old, wearing a “*FUCK TRUMP*{: .small}” T-shirt, was grabbed by the breast, thrown to the ground, slapped in the face. (She was also told to “go back on the boat,” a perplexing instruction, given that she was born and raised in Mesa.) Later that day, in Tucson, two young Hispanic women, quietly watching the rally there, are thrown out of the venue, and one (as a member of Trump’s security staff bellows, “Out! Out! Out!”) is roughly shoved through a revolving door by a Trump supporter who looks to be in his seventies and who then performs a strange little quasi-karate move, as if he expects her to fly back in and counterattack. A pro-immigration protester named George Clifton, who is wearing a sign that says “*Veteran: U.S.M.C. _and_ C.I.A.*{: .small},” tells me that two Trump supporters came up to him separately after the Fountain Hills rally and whispered “almost verbatim the same thing, not quite, but in a nutshell”: that they’d like to shoot him in the back of the head.\n\n## I’m Here for an Argument\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn Tucson, Trump supporters flow out of the Convention Center like a red-white-and-blue river, along hostile riverbanks made of protesters, who have situated themselves so as to be maximally irritating. When a confrontation occurs, people rush toward it, to film it and stoke it, in the hope that someone on the other side will fly off the handle and do something extreme, and thereby incontrovertibly discredit his side of the argument. This river-and-shore arrangement advantages the Trump supporters: they can walk coolly past, playing the offended party, refusing to engage.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost do, but some don’t. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b66ddf60db474ba953c9d]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n“Trump is racist, so are *YOU*{: .small}!” the protesters chant, maximizing the provocation. A South Asian-looking youth of uncertain political affiliation does a crazy Borat dance in front of the line as a friend films him. An aging blond bombshell strolls by in a low-cut blouse, giving the protesters a leisurely finger, blowing them kisses, patting one of her large breasts. A matronly Hispanic protester says that the woman has a right to do what she likes with her breasts since, after all, “she paid for them.” A grandmotherly white woman tucks a strand of graying hair behind her ear, walks resolutely over, and delicately lifts a Mexican flag from where it lies shawl-like across the shoulders of a young, distractedly dancing Hispanic girl, as if the flag had fallen across the girl’s shoulders from some imaginary shelf and the grandmother were considerately removing it before it got too heavy. The girl, offended, pulls away. But wait: the woman shows her anti-Trump sign: they’re on the same side. The girl remains unconvinced; she’ll keep the flag to herself, thanks. “So _sorry_,” the white woman says and rejoins a friend, to commiserate over the girl’s response, which strikes her, maybe, as a form of racial profiling.\n\n\n\nTwo tall Trump supporters tower over a small liberal in a green T-shirt.\n\n\n\n“Stupid! Uneducated!” Trumpie A shouts. “Do you know anything that goes _on_ in the world?”\n\n\n\n“Articulate a little more,” the guy in the green shirt says.\n\n\n\n“I don’t want to live in a fascist country!” Trumpie B says.\n\n\n\n“You don’t know what fascism _is_,” Green Shirt says.\n\n\n\n“Oh, I’m getting there, man!” Trumpie B says. “Obama’s teaching me!”\n\n\n\n“Go back to California,” Trumpie A shouts at Green Shirt. “Bitch!”\n\n\n\nThe four of us stand in a tight little circle, Trumpie A shouting insults at Green Shirt while filming Green Shirt’s reaction, me filming Trumpie A filming Green Shirt. The bulk and intensity of the Trumpies, plus the fact that Green Shirt seems to be serving as designated spokesperson for a group of protesters now gathering around, appears to be making Green Shirt nervous.\n\n\n\n“Obama’s teaching you what fascism is?” he sputters. “Obama’s a fascist? The left is the fascists? This is so rich! So, like, the people who are being oppressed are the oppressors?”\n\n\n\n“Do you know what’s going on in the world, man?” Trumpie A says. “You’re not fucking _educated_.”\n\n\n\nThis stings.\n\n\n\n“I am very educated,” Green Shirt says.\n\n\n\n“You have no _idea_ what’s going on,” Trumpie B says.\n\n\n\n“I am very educated,” Green Shirt says.\n\n\n\n“You’ve got no idea, bro,” Trumpie A says sadly.\n\n\n\n“Ask me a question, ask me a question,” Green Shirt says.\n\n\n\nThe Tall Trumpies, bored, wander away.\n\n\n\nGreen Shirt turns to one of his friends. “Am I educated?”\n\n\n\n“You’re fucking educated,” the friend says.\n\n\n\nGreen Shirt shouts at the Tall Trumpies (who, fortunately for him, are now safely out of earshot), “And I’ll stomp the fucking _shit_ out of you!”\n\n\n\nSpotting a round-faced, brown-skinned youth in a “Make America Great Again” T-shirt, who’s been quietly listening nearby, Green Shirt snarls, “And _you_ can get your fat fucking Chinese face out of here.”\n\n\n\nThe kid seems more quizzical than hurt.\n\n\n\nI ask Green Shirt for clarification: did he just tell that guy to get his Chinese face out of here?\n\n\n\n“No, I was calling his _shirt_ Chinese,” he clarifies. “I told him to get his Chinese _shirt_ out of here. The Trump campaign gets those shirts from China.”\n\n\n\nI’m relieved. My liberal comrade did not commit a racial slur.\n\n\n\n“I did call him fat, though,” he admits, then dashes back over to the kid, hisses, “Why don’t you make your _waistline_ great again?,” and slips away into the crowd.\n\n\n\n“This is America!” a Trump supporter rages desperately into the line of protesters, after one of them forces his phone camera down. “I’m American! I’m Mexican-American! Are you a marine?” he demands of an elderly protester in a floppy fatigue hat. “I’m a veteran. I’m a _veteran_. You’re idiots. You’re _idiots_. I’m a Navy corpsman! I saved marines’ _asses_. Mexican, white, and black. We’re red, white, and blue!” The guy in the floppy hat answers, in heavily accented English, that, yes, he was a marine. This conflict rapidly devolves into a bitter veteran-off: two old guys, who’ve presumably seen some things in their time, barking hatefully at each other. I know (or _feel_ I know) that, on another day, these two guys might have grabbed a beer together, jump-started each other’s cars, whatever—but they’re not doing that today.\n\n\n\n“What are you _doing_ here?” a girl shouts at the Trump-supporting Mexican-American former corpsman. “You should be ashamed!”\n\n\n\n“What am I doing?” he shouts back. “I’m supporting a man who’s going to clean up Mexico, build a wall, fix the economy!”\n\n\n\n“_Puto!_” a protester snaps, as the corpsman storms off, to go home and, I’m guessing, feel like crap the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nIf you are, as I am, a sentimental middle-aged person who cherishes certain Coplandian notions about the essential goodness of the nation, seeing this kind of thing in person—adults shouting wrathfully at one another with no intention of persuasion, invested only in escalating spite—will inject a palpable sadness into your thinning, under-exercised legs, and you may find yourself collapsing, post-rally, against a tree in a public park, feeling hopeless. Craving something positive (no more fighting, no more invective, please, please), forcing yourself to your feet, you may cross a busy avenue and find, in a mini-mall themed like Old Mexico, a wedding about to begin. Up will walk the bridesmaids, each leading, surprisingly, a dog on a leash, and each dog is wearing a tutu, and one, a puppy too small to be trusted in a procession, is being carried, in its tutu, in the arms of its bridesmaid.\n\n\n\nAnd this will somehow come as an unbelievable relief.\n\n## Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b66df5d2f45736c34d056]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWhere is all this anger coming from? It’s viral, and Trump is Typhoid Mary. Intellectually and emotionally weakened by years of steadily degraded public discourse, we are now two separate ideological countries, LeftLand and RightLand, speaking different languages, the lines between us down. Not only do our two subcountries reason differently; they draw upon non-intersecting data sets and access entirely different mythological systems. You and I approach a castle. One of us has watched only “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” the other only “Game of Thrones.” What is the meaning, to the collective “we,” of yon castle? We have no common basis from which to discuss it. You, the other knight, strike me as bafflingly ignorant, a little unmoored. In the old days, a liberal and a conservative (a “dove” and a “hawk,” say) got their data from one of three nightly news programs, a local paper, and a handful of national magazines, and were thus starting with the same basic facts (even if those facts were questionable, limited, or erroneous). Now each of us constructs a custom informational universe, wittingly (we choose to go to the sources that uphold our existing beliefs and thus flatter us) or unwittingly (our app algorithms do the driving for us). The data we get this way, pre-imprinted with spin and mythos, are intensely one-dimensional. (As a proud knight of LeftLand, I was interested to find that, in RightLand, Vince Foster has still been murdered, Dick Morris is a reliable source, kids are brainwashed “way to the left” by going to college, and Obama may yet be Muslim. I expect that my interviewees found some of my core beliefs equally jaw-dropping.)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Trump supporter in Fountain Hills asks me, “If you’re a liberal, do you believe in the government controlling everything? Because that’s what Barry wants to do, and what he’s pretty much accomplished.” She then makes the (to me, irrational and irritating) claim that more people are on welfare under Obama than ever were under Bush.\n\n\n\n“Almost fifty million people,” her husband says. “Up thirty per cent.”\n\n\n\nI make a certain sound I make when I disagree with something but have no facts at my disposal.\n\n\n\nBack at the hotel, I Google it.\n\n\n\nDamn it, they’re right. Rightish.\n\n\n\nWhat I find over the next hour or so, from a collection of Web sites, left, right, and fact-based:\n\n\n\nYes, true: there are approximately seven million more Americans in poverty now than when Obama was elected. On the other hand, the economy under Obama has gained about seven times as many jobs as it did under Bush; even given the financial meltdown, the unemployment rate has dropped to just below the historical average. But, yes: the poverty _rate_ is up by 1.6 percentage points since 2008. Then again the _number_ of Americans in poverty fell by nearly 1.2 million between 2012 and 2013. However, true: the proportion of people who depend on welfare for the majority of their income _has_ increased (although it was also increasing under Bush). And under Obama unemployment has dropped, G.D.P. growth has been “robust,” and there have been close to seventy straight months of job growth. But, O.K.: there has indeed been a “skyrocketing” in the number of Americans needing some form of means-tested federal aid, although Obama’s initiatives kept some six million people out of poverty in 2009, including more than two million children.\n\n\n\nSo the couple’s assertion was true but not _complexly_ true. It was a nice hammer with which to pop the enemy; i.e., me. Its intent: discredit Obama and the liberal mind-set. What was my intent as I Googled? Get a hammer of my own, discredit Bush and the conservative mind-set.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there sat reality: huge, ambiguous, too complicated to be usefully assessed by our prevailing mutual ambition—to fight and win, via delivery of the partisan zinger.\n\n\n\nLeftLand and RightLand are housemates who are no longer on speaking terms. And then the house is set on fire. By Donald Trump. Good people from both subnations gape at one another through the smoke.\n\n## Who Are They? (Part I)\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIt’s clear enough to those of us who don’t like Trump why we don’t like him. What isn’t clear is why it isn’t clear to those who like him. The Trump supporter is your brother who has just brought home a wildly inappropriate fiancée. Well, inappropriate to _you_. Trump support, nationwide, stands at around forty per cent. If you had ten siblings and four of them brought home wildly inappropriate fiancées, you might feel inclined to ask yourself what was going on in your family to make your judgment and that of your siblings so divergent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems futile to try to generalize about a group as large and disparate as “Trump supporters”—like generalizing, say, “people who own riding lawnmowers,” who, of course, tend to be, but are not exclusively limited to, people with large or largish lawns, but can also include people with small yards, who, for whatever reason, can’t manage a push mower, and/or people (both large- and small-yarded) who may have received a riding mower from a father-in-law or an uncle and don’t want to rock the boat. But sometimes, standing at a rally among several thousand madly cheering Trump supporters, I’d think, All these people have _something_ in common. What is it?\n\n\n\nI didn’t meet many people who were unreservedly for Trump. There is, in the quiver containing his ideas, something for nearly everyone to dislike. But there is also something for nearly everyone to _like_. What allows a person not crazy about Trump to vote for him is a certain prioritization: a person might, for example, like Trump’s ideas about trade, or his immigration policies, or the fact that Trump is, as one supporter told me, “a successful businessman,” who has “actually done something,” unlike Obama, who has “never done anything his entire life.”\n\n\n\nThe Trump supporters I spoke with were friendly, generous with their time, flattered to be asked their opinion, willing to give it, even when they knew I was a liberal writer likely to throw them under the bus. They loved their country, seemed genuinely panicked at its perceived demise, felt urgently that we were, right now, in the process of losing something precious. They were, generally, in favor of _order_ and had a propensity toward the broadly normative, a certain squareness. They leaned toward skepticism (they’d believe it when they saw it, “it” being anything feelings-based, gauzy, liberal, or European; i.e., “socialist”). Some (far from all) had been touched by financial hardship—a layoff was common in many stories—and (paradoxically, given their feelings about socialism) felt that, while in that vulnerable state, they’d been let down by their government. They were anti-regulation, pro small business, pro Second Amendment, suspicious of people on welfare, sensitive (in a “Don’t tread on me” way) about any infringement whatsoever on their freedom. Alert to charges of racism, they would pre-counter these by pointing out that they had friends of all colors. They were adamantly for law enforcement and veterans’ rights, in a manner that presupposed that the rest of us were adamantly against these things. It seemed self-evident to them that a businessman could and should lead the country. “You run your family like a business, don’t you?” I was asked more than once, although, of course, I don’t, and none of us do. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b66e11f743c6ee49a55be]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Trump supporter comes out of the conservative tradition but is not a traditional conservative. He is less patient: something is bothering him and he wants it stopped _now_, by any means necessary. He seems less influenced by Goldwater and Reagan than by Fox News and reality TV, his understanding of history recent and selective; he is less religiously grounded and more willing, in his acceptance of Trump’s racist and misogynist excesses, to (let’s say) forgo the niceties.\n\n\n\nAs for Trump’s uncivil speech—the insults, the petty meanness, the crudeness, the talk about hand size, the assurance, on national TV, that his would-be Presidential dick is up to the job, his mastery of the jaw-droppingly untrue personal smear (Obama is Kenyan, Ted Cruz’s dad was in cahoots with Lee Harvey Oswald, U.S. Muslims knew what was “going on” pre-Orlando), which he often dishonorably eases into the world by attaching some form of the phrase “many people have said this” (_The world is flat; many people have said this. People are saying that birds can play the cello:_ _we need to look into that_)—his supporters seem constitutionally reluctant to object, as if the act of objecting would mark them as fatally delicate. Objecting to this sort of thing is for the coddled, the liberal, the élite. “Yeah, he can really improve, in the way he says things,” one woman in Fountain Hills tells me. “But who gives a shit? Because if he’s going to get the job done? I’m just saying. You can’t let your feelings get hurt. It’s kind of like, get over it, you know what I mean? What’s the big picture here? The big picture is we’ve got to get America back on track.”\n\n\n\nThe ability to shrug off the mean crack, the sexist joke, the gratuitous jab at the weak is, in some quarters, seen as a form of strength, of “being flexible,” of “not taking shit serious.” A woman who wilts at a sexist joke won’t last long in certain workplaces. A guy who prioritizes the sensitive side of his nature will, trust me, not thrive in the slaughterhouse. This willingness to gloss over crudeness becomes, then, an encoded sign of competence, strength, and reliability.\n\n\n\nAbove all, Trump supporters are “not politically correct,” which, as far as I can tell, means that they have a particular aversion to that psychological moment when, having thought something, you decide that it is not a good thought, and might pointlessly hurt someone’s feelings, and therefore decline to say it.\n\n## Who are They? (Part II)\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nI observed, in Trump supporters’ storytelling, a tendency to conflate things that, to a non-Trump supporter, might seem unrelated. For example, in 2014, Mary Ann Mendoza’s son, Brandon, an openly gay policeman in Mesa, who volunteered at the local Boys and Girls Club, was killed in a car accident caused by an intoxicated, undocumented Mexican man who had spent at least twenty years drifting in and out of the U.S. and had been charged with a number of crimes, including assaulting a police officer, and was convicted of criminal conspiracy, but was free at the time of the crash, having been shown leniency by a Colorado court. At the rally in Fountain Hills, Ms. Mendoza gave a moving speech about her son, which she concluded this way: “This was the kind of man my son was. . . . _Was_. Not is. _Was_. Because of the lack of concern that this Administration has for American citizens. . . . Brandon’s. Life. Matters.” The crowd roared. Something key lay in that juxtaposition and that roar. What was the connection between her son’s death and the Black Lives Matter movement? Couldn’t a person be against the killing of innocent black men _and_ against illegal immigration (or drunk driving, or the lax enforcement of existing laws, etc.)?\n\n\n\n\n\nA man comes to Arizona from Vermont and finds that “the illegals” are getting all the kitchen jobs for which he’s qualified. “So once Trump started talking about the Wall,” he says, “I was like, all right, now I think I’ve got to start paying attention to this.” How does he know those workers were undocumented? He doesn’t; there’s no way, situationally, that he could. Stephanie, an executive administrator for a finance group in Minnesota, gets laid off, and the only benefit she qualifies for is “a measly little unemployment check.” Standing next to her at the government office are “these people, that are from other countries, non-speaking—I’m not biased, I have no reason to be—but . . . I’m seeing them getting cash, getting their bills paid, and, as a taxpaying citizen, I don’t get anything. And so the border thing really resonated with me.” Does she know for a fact that these were illegal immigrants? “That’s a good question, and I don’t know the answer,” she says. “I’m not a hundred per cent on it.”\n\n\n\nBill Davis, a funny, genial sales rep in the packaging industry, has nothing against legal immigration but feels that illegal immigration is “killing” the area in Southern California where he lives. How, specifically, is it doing this? He mentions a neighbor of his who speaks no English, has two hundred chickens running around his yard, goats everywhere, doesn’t “play by the rules”—and hence Bill’s property values are going down. Is his neighbor undocumented? It doesn’t matter, he says. He’s “not assimilated.” Growing up, Davis says, he had a lot of first-generation Hispanic friends. These people took pride in assimilating. “Those days are over,” he explains. “So Trump is onto something about that. We don’t want you guys throwing your fast-food wrappers out your windows when you’re driving down the freeway. Take some pride in what you do. And learn to work in this country by the rules and regulations that we’ve developed over two hundred and fifty years. I’m not opposed to immigration, by any means. Come here, but when you leave Mexico—when you leave Germany, when you leave Russia, wherever—you’ve left that culture for a reason. It’s America now. So you can have your parties and your stuff at your house, but don’t expect us to cater to your culture.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b66e2edb25442b234e76f]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n“Thousands of Cubans coming in,” Kathryn Kobor, a Trump supporter and animal-rights activist in her seventies, tells me in Phoenix, as she sits in protest of the Hillary Clinton rally across the street, beneath an umbrella provided by a Clinton supporter. “Three hundred sixty thousand Guatemalan kids and mothers standing at the border, they have to be taken in. We’re going to be taking in thousands of Syrians, whom we cannot vet.” I tell her that the thought of deporting and dividing families breaks my heart. “Of course it does—you’re a human, you care about people. That’s not the question. The question is, Do you want to live like India? Sewage running in the streets? . . . The infrastructure is crumbling. . . . I’m not speaking for tomorrow. I’m not speaking for a year, two years from now. I’ll be gone. I’m speaking for my descendants. I have a granddaughter. I have a son. I want them to live a decent, clean life. . . . Trump just wants the laws enforced. . . . He’s not a mean-spirited person.”\n\n\n\nA former marine in line for a Trump rally in Rothschild, Wisconsin, tells me that, returning to the U.S. from a deployment overseas, he found himself wondering, “Where did my country go?” To clarify, he tells me that he was in Qatar on the day that Obama was first elected. “I was actually sitting in the chow hall when they announced the results and he gave his speech,” he says. “I saw such a division at that time. Every black member of the military was cheering. Everybody else was sitting there mute. Like stunned.”\n\n\n\nWhat unites these stories is what I came to think of as usurpation anxiety syndrome—the feeling that one is, or is about to be, scooped, overrun, or taken advantage of by some Other with questionable intentions. In some cases, this has a racial basis, and usurpation anxiety grades into racial nostalgia, which can grade into outright racism, albeit cloaked in disclaimer.\n\n\n\nIn the broadest sense, the Trump supporter might be best understood as a guy who wakes up one day in a lively, crowded house full of people, from a dream in which he was the only one living there, and then mistakes the dream for the past: a better time, manageable and orderly, during which privilege and respect came to him naturally, and he had the whole place to himself.\n\n## How Do You Solve a Problem Like Noemi?\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nTalking to a Trump supporter about Trump’s deportation policy, I’d sometimes bring up Noemi Romero, a sweet, soft-spoken young woman I met in Phoenix. Noemi was brought to the U.S. when she was three, by undocumented parents. A few years ago, she had the idea of applying for legal status through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (*DACA*{: .small}) program. But the application costs four hundred and sixty-five dollars, money her family didn’t have. Hearing that a local Vietnamese grocery was hiring, she borrowed her mother’s Social Security card and got the job. A few months later, the store was raided. Noemi was arrested, charged with aggravated identity theft and forgery, and taken to jail and held there, within the general prison population, for two months. She was given spoiled milk, and food that, she said, had tiny worms in it. Her lawyer arranged a plea bargain; the charges were reduced to criminal impersonation. This was a good deal, he told her, the best she could hope for. She accepted, not realizing that, as a convicted felon, she would be permanently ineligible for *DACA*{: .small}. Puente, a local grassroots organization, intervened and saved her from deportation, but she is essentially doomed to a kind of frozen life: can’t work and can’t go to college, although she has lived virtually her whole life in the U.S. and has no reason to go back to Mexico and nowhere to live if she’s sent there.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’d ask the Trump supporter, “What do we do about Noemi?” I always found the next moment in our exchange hopeful.\n\n\n\nIs she a good person? the Trump supporter might ask. I couldn’t feel more sorry for her, he might say. That kid is no better or worse than I am and deserves the best God can give her. Or he might say that deportation would have to be done on a case-by-case basis. Or propose some sort of registry—Noemi, having registered, would go back to Mexico and, if all checked out, come right back in. There had to be some kind of rule of law, didn’t there? Tellingly, the Trump supporter might confess that she didn’t think Trump really intended to do this mass-deportation thing anyway—it was all just campaign talk. The most extreme supporter might say that, yes, Noemi had to go—he didn’t like it, but ultimately the fault lay with her parents.\n\n\n\nSometimes I’d mention a Central American family I met in Texas, while reporting another story. In that case, the father and son were documented but the mother and daughters weren’t. Would you, I’d ask, split that family up? Send those girls to a country in which they’d never spent a single day? Well, my Trump-supporting friend might answer, it was complicated, wasn’t it? Were they good people? Yes, I’d say. The father, in spare moments between his three jobs, built a four-bedroom house out of cinder blocks he acquired two or three at a time from Home Depot, working sometimes late into the night. The Trump supporter might, at this point, fall silent, and so might I.\n\n\n\nIn the face of specificity, my interviewees began trying, really trying, to think of what would be fairest and most humane for this real person we had imaginatively conjured up. It wasn’t that we suddenly agreed, but the tone changed. We popped briefly out of zinger mode and began to have some faith in one another, a shared confidence that if we talked long enough, respectfully enough, a solution could be found that might satisfy our respective best notions of who we were.\n\n\n\nWell, let’s not get too dreamy about it. We’d stay in that mode for a minute or two, then be off again to some new topic, rewrapped in our respective Left and Right national flags. Once, after what felt like a transcendent and wide-ranging conversation with a Trump supporter named Danny (a former railroad worker, now on disability), I said a fond goodbye and went to interview some Hillary supporters across the street. A few minutes later, I looked over to find Danny shouting at us that Hillary was going to prison, not the White House. I waved to him, but he didn’t seem to see me, hidden there in the crowd of his adversaries.\n\n## The Elephant in the Room\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe average Trump supporter is not the rally pugilist, the white supremacist, the bitter conspiracy theorist, though these exist and are drawn to Trump (see: _the Internet_)—and, at times, the first flowerings of these tendencies were present among some of the rank-and-file supporters I met. A certain barely suppressed rage, for example, is evident in the guy in Phoenix who wears his gun to a protest against Hillary (“I’m out here with two friends, Smith and Wesson”). One of his fellow-protesters tells me that Hillary has had oral sex with many female world leaders (“She’s munched with a lot of our enemies, man”).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a rally in Eau Claire, a handful of Trump protesters stand silently in the Wisconsin cold as the Trump supporters file out—a spontaneous little lab experiment investigating the Trumpies’ response to silent rebuke. “I guess you guys don’t read too much,” someone shouts at the protesters. “Or watch the news. _Fox News!_ Watch that once in a while!” Other Trump supporters yell over incredulously, “Fifteen bucks an hour?” And “Go to socialist Europe! Save your checks and move to a socialist country!”\n\n\n\nBut the line I won’t forget comes from a guy leaving the rally, alone, who shout-mutters, if such a thing is possible, “Hey, I’m not paying for your shit, I’m not paying for your college, so you go to Hell, go to work, go to Hell, suck a dick.”\n\n\n\nNot far away, a group of enterprising Girl Scouts is out late, selling cookies under a winter-leafless tree. “Cookies for sale, last time this season,” they seem to sing. “Girl Scout cookies, last weekend to get them.”\n\n\n\nSo, yes, there are bigots in the Trump movement, and wackos, and dummies, and sometimes I had to remind myself that the important constituency is the persuadable middle segment of his supporters, who are not finding in Trump a suitable vessel for their hate but are misunderstanding him or overestimating him, and moving in his direction out of a misplaced form of hope.\n\n## Who Are They? (Part III)\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nSometimes it seemed that they were, like me, just slightly spoiled Americans, imbued with unreasonable boomer expectations for autonomy, glory, and ascension, and that their grievances were more theoretical than actual, more media-induced than experience-related.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the rally in San Jose on June 2nd, I talk to a group of construction workers, each of whom is in some state of layoff: current, recent, chronic. One, who’s hoping to get a job working construction on the Wall, rails against millennials, the unions, a minimum-wage hike for fast-food workers, and “these people” who get fired, then turn around and sue. I ask for examples. He says he isn’t going to give me any names. I say forget the names, just tell me a particular story. A guy got fired from his workplace just last week, he says. “Is he suing?” I ask. “Well, probably,” he says.\n\n\n\nI ask one of his friends, a thoughtful Chinese-American guy, how his life has been made worse over the past eight years. He comes up with this: he pays more for his insurance because of Obamacare. Anything else? Not really. How has he personally been affected by illegal immigration? He hasn’t, he tells me, but he’s been fortunate enough to have the resources to keep his family away from the danger.\n\n\n\nAt one point, in line at the Fountain Hills rally, frustrated by a litany of anti-Obama grievances being delivered by the woman in front of me, I say that I think life is good, pretty good, you know?\n\n\n\n“You think this is _good_?” she says.\n\n\n\n“I do, yeah,” I say. “We’re out here on a nice day, having a beautiful talk—”\n\n\n\nShe groans, meaning, You know that’s not what I mean. \n\n\n\nBut I don’t, really, so I ask her what, in terms of her day-to-day life, she thinks is wrong with America.\n\n\n\n“I don’t like people shoving Obamacare down my throat, O.K.?” she says. “And then getting penalized if I don’t have insurance.”\n\n\n\nIs she covered through Obamacare?\n\n\n\nNo. She has insurance through her work, thank God, but “every day my rights are being taken away from me, you know?” she says. “I mean—this is America. In the U.S., we have a lot of freedoms and things like that, but we’re not going to have all that if we have all these people coming in, that are taking our—”\n\n\n\n“We have our own people to take care of, I’m sorry,” interjects a seventeen-year-old girl who is standing nearby, holding up a sign that says “*Marry Me Don*{: .small}.”\n\n## Who Are They? (Part IV)\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAmerican Presidential campaigns are not about ideas; they are about the selection of a hero to embody the prevailing national ethos. “Only a hero,” Mailer wrote, “can capture the secret imagination of a people, and so be good for the vitality of his nation; a hero embodies the fantasy and so allows each private mind the liberty to consider its fantasy and find a way to grow. Each mind can become more conscious of its desire and waste less strength in hiding from itself.” What fantasy is Trump giving his supporters the liberty to consider? What secret have they been hiding from themselves?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump seems to awaken something in them that they feel they have, until now, needed to suppress. What is that thing? It is not just (as I’m getting a bit tired of hearing) that they’ve been _left behind economically_. (Many haven’t, and au contraire.) They’ve been left behind in other ways, too, or feel that they have. To them, this is attributable to a country that has moved away from them, has been _taken away_ from them—by Obama, the Clintons, the “lamestream” media, the “élites,” the business-as-usual politicians. They are stricken by a sense that things are not as they should be and that, finally, someone sees it their way. They have a case of Grievance Mind, and Trump is their head kvetcher. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b66e457b86d47b169c98f]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nIn college, I was a budding Republican, an Ayn Rand acolyte. I voted for Reagan. I’d been a bad student in high school and now, in engineering school, felt (and was) academically outgunned, way behind the curve. In that state, I constructed a world view in which I was not behind the curve but ahead of it. I conjured up a set of hazy villains, who were, I can see now, externalized manifestations, imaginary versions of those who were leaving me behind; i.e., my better-prepared, more sophisticated fellow-students. They were, yes, smarter and sharper than I was (as indicated by the tests on which they were always creaming me), but I was . . . what was I? Uh, tougher, more resilient, more able to get down and dirty as needed. I distinctly remember the feeling of casting about for some world view in which my shortfall somehow constituted a hidden noble advantage.\n\n\n\nWhile reporting this story, I drove from New York to California. During all those days on the highway, with lots of time on my hands for theorizing, generalizing, and speaking my generalized theories into my iPhone while swerving off into the spacious landscape, I thought about this idea of grievance, of feeling left behind. All along the fertile interstate-highway corridor, our corporations, those new and powerful nation-states, had set up shop parasitically, so as to skim off the drive-past money, and what those outposts had to offer was a blur of sugar, bright color, and crassness that seemed causally related to more serious addictions. Standing in line at the pharmacy in an Amarillo Walmart superstore, I imagined some kid who had moved only, or mostly, through such bland, bright spaces, spaces constructed to suit the purposes of distant profit, and it occurred to me how easy it would be, in that life, to feel powerless, to feel that the local was lame, the abstract extraneous, to feel that the only valid words were those of materialism (“get” and “rise”)—words that are perfectly embodied by the candidate of the moment.\n\n\n\nSomething is wrong, the common person feels, correctly: she works too hard and gets too little; a dulling disconnect exists between her actual day-to-day interests and (1) the way her leaders act and speak, and (2) the way our mass media mistell or fail entirely to tell her story. What does she want? Someone to notice her over here, having her troubles.\n\n## But, Then Again, Come On \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nA bully shows up, is hateful, says things so crude we liberals are taken aback. We respond moderately. We keep waiting for his supporters, helped along by how compassionately and measuredly we are responding, to be persuaded. For the bully, this is perfect. Every fresh outrage pulls the camera back to him, and meanwhile those of us moderately decrying his immoderation are a little boring and tepid, and he keeps getting out ahead of us. He has Trumpmunity: his notions are so low and have been so many times decried, and yet they keep arriving, in new and escalating varieties, and the liberal imagination wilts.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been mentally gathering all those nice, friendly Trump supporters I met and asking them, Still? Even after the Curiel fiasco and the post-Orlando self-congrat fest, and Trump’s insinuation that President Obama was in cahoots with the terrorists? Guys, still, really? The tragedy of the Trump movement is that one set of struggling people has been pitted against other groups of struggling people by someone who has known little struggle, at least in the material sense, and hence seems to have little empathy for anyone struggling, and even to consider struggling a symptom of weakness. “I will never let you down,” he has told his supporters, again and again, but he will, and in fact already has, by indulging the fearful, xenophobic, Other-averse parts of their psychology and reinforcing the notion that their sense of being left behind has no source in themselves.\n\n## All That Bad Energy Comes Home to Roost \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAh, how fondly I now recall those idyllic rally days in Fountain Hills, Tucson, Rothschild, and Eau Claire, back in March and early April, when the punching was being done by Trump supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the San Jose rally in early June, protesters bullied and spat on straggling Trump supporters. Sucker punchers lurched up, punched hard, darted away, hands raised in victory. A strange little protester, mask around his neck, mumbled, as he scuttled past a female reporter conducting an interview, “Fuck you in the pussy.” Some sick genie, it seemed, had been let out of the bottle. I had to pull an older white woman out of a moblet of slapping young women of color, after she’d been driven down to one knee and had her glasses knocked off. When I told the young African-American woman who’d given the first slap that this was exactly the kind of thing the Trump movement loved to see and would be happy to use, she seemed to suddenly come back to herself and nearly burst into tears. The slapped woman was around sixty, tall, lean, sun-reddened, scrappy, a rancher, maybe, and we stood there a few minutes, recovering ourselves. Seeing something unsteady behind her eyes, I suggested that she be sure to take a few deep breaths before driving home. She said she would, but a few minutes later I saw her again, at the edge of the crowd, watching the protesters in fascination, as if what had just happened to her made it impossible for her to leave.\n\n\n\nThe order to disperse was given, first from a helicopter circling above, then barked out repeatedly on the ground, through megaphones. Police, in riot gear, stepped forward, shoulder to shoulder, chanting, “*MOVE MOVE MOVE*{: .small}!,” and the kids played at revolution, chanting back, “*HANDS UP! DON’T SHOOT*{: .small}!” and “*FUCK TRUMP*{: .small}!” and “*FUCK THE SYSTEM*{: .small}!” and “*FUCK THE POLICE*{: .small}!,” occasionally dashing ahead of the advancing line to gain a few minutes to call home on their cells to reassure their worried parents. The police line formed a human wiper blade that, over the next couple of hours, drove the protesters around and around the downtown area. It was like some large-form board game: the longer the blue wiper blade pushed forward, the more protesters fell off the game board and went home, until, finally, only a handful remained, regrouping in the dark under the freeway.\n\n\n\nUp on grassless viaduct slopes, whippet-thin young men of color gathered stones, carried them down furtively in clenched fists. When asked not to throw them, they averted their eyes guiltily, the way a busted third grader might. Some dropped their rocks; others just slipped away into the crowd. I saw two friends hurl their rocks at once, high, weak, arcing throws that burst up through street-light-yellow, low-hanging branches. I told an African-American kid wearing an elaborate Darth Vaderish multi-mask arrangement that this made him look like he was up to no good and aggravated the ambient white-privileged notion of the protesters as thugs out to make trouble. He sweetly agreed, but then (dashing off) said that, still, the protesters “have to do what we have to do.”\n\n\n\nThey were so young, mostly peaceful, but angered by the hateful rhetoric addressed at their communities, and their disdain for Trump morphed too easily into disrespect for the police, a group of whom, when all was over, huddled in a bank doorway, bathed in sweat, a couple of them taking a knee, football style, and when their helmets came off it was clear that they’d been scared, too, and I imagined them later that night, in darkened living rooms, reviewing the night, assessing how they’d done.\n\n\n\nEarly in the evening, a protester about my age asked me, “Where’s your sheet?” Seeing my confusion, he regrouped. “If you’re a Trump supporter, I mean.” Later, I saw him again, shouting to the police that they were all “pigs.” Still smarting over his Klan crack, I asked how he could hold a sign claiming that hate doesn’t work while calling a group of people he didn’t know “pigs.” “They _are_ pigs,” he said. “Every one of them.” His wife was murdered a few years ago, he added, and they did nothing about it.\n\n\n\nSo there you go. Welcome to America.\n\n\n\nThe night was sad. The center failed to hold. Did I blame the rioting kids? I did. Did I blame Trump? I did. This, Mr. Trump, I thought, is why we practice civility. This is why, before we say exactly what is on our minds, we run it past ourselves, to see if it makes sense, is true, is fair, has a flavor of kindness, and won’t hurt someone or make someone’s difficult life more difficult. Because there are, among us, in every political camp, limited, angry, violent, and/or damaged people, waiting for any excuse to throw off the tethers of restraint and get after it. After which it falls to the rest of us, right and left, to clean up the mess.\n\n## The Somewhat Better Angels of Our Nature\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWell, it wasn’t all doom and gloom. Who could fail to be cheered by the sight of a self-described “street preacher” named Dean, whose massive laminated sign read “*Muhammad Is a Liar, False Prophet, Child Raping Pervert*{: .small}! (see history for details)” and, on the flip side, “*Homo Sex Is Sin—*{: .small}Romans 1,” being verbally taken down by an inspiring consortium consisting of a gay white agnostic for Trump, a straight Christian girl for Trump, and a lesbian Latina agnostic for Bernie? Who could resist the raw wonder in the voice of a rangy young Trump supporter who reminded me of a gentler version of Sid Phillips, the bad neighbor boy in “Toy Story,” as he said, rather dreamily, “I love that everything in Trump’s house is gold. That’s like real-life Batman. That’s some real Bruce Wayne shit.” A group of anti-Trump college students in Eau Claire concocted the perfect Zen protest: singing and dancing en masse to Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” If there’s anything common across the left-right divide, it’s the desire not to come off as tight-assed or anti-rock and roll, and what could the passing Trump supporters do but dance and sing along, a few holdouts scowling at the unfairness of the method?\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside a Clinton rally in Phoenix, a Native American-looking man in an Aztec-patterned shirt joined the line of Trump supporters, with his megaphone, through which he slowly said, one word at a time, “Make. America. White. Again.” Once the Trump supporters caught on to the joke, they moved away, but he was a good sport and scooted down to join them.\n\n\n\n“Make. America. White. Again,” he said, in the calmest voice.\n\n\n\n“We don’t want you,” one of the Trumpies said. “We don’t want your racism!”\n\n\n\nAnd civility is still alive and well, if you know where to look for it. Outside a Lutheran church meeting hall in Mesa that is being used as a polling place on primary day, for example, where an eighty-eight-year-old woman sits, beautifully dressed for the occasion. “Oh, my goodness,” she says. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”\n\n\n\nHundreds of voters are waiting in a line that runs around the parking lot and down the street. She came earlier, she says, and thought she might just forget it. “But then,” she says, “I thought, I’m getting up there in years—not going to have that many more chances to vote. I don’t want to skip it. Because I always vote.”\n\n\n\nThe voters move slowly, under crossed palm fronds, up for Palm Sunday, past a grapefruit tree in a gravelled breezeway: its three trunks have been whitewashed, and it looks like a three-legged creature in white pants, standing on its head.\n\n\n\nFor the next five hours, America passes by, wearing work badges, fanny packs, surgical scrubs, sparkly dance-short-leotards, suspenders, wool caps, head scarves, dreadlocks; pushing walkers, baby strollers, a fat-wheeled trail bike, a shopping cart (containing a bamboo cane and a Burger King crown); carrying walkie-talkies, books, a man-purse shaped like a gigantic tennis shoe, squirming babies, portable fold-up seats that never get used.\n\n\n\nSomeone says that in twenty-nine years she’s never seen this level of excitement. Someone says that it takes all kinds. Someone says that this is what makes the U.S. great: so much difference, and everyone gets a chance. Someone says that there are so many extremes at play in this election, people are coming out just to resist the extreme they’re most against.\n\n\n\nA man says, “I’m a good guy, I hope,” and his wife nods.\n\n\n\nA hipster dad picks up a bit of cookie his kid has dropped on the sidewalk and eats it.\n\n\n\nA college-age kid in a “Captain America” shirt demonstrates that there is a certain portion of one’s elbow flesh that will never hurt, no matter how hard one pinches it.\n\n\n\nAt seven, the polls are supposed to close, but the line is the longest it’s been all day.\n\n\n\nNo one seems angry. There isn’t much political talk, and what there is is restrained, chatty. They are here to vote, and that is a privilege and a private matter.\n\n\n\nHow fragile this mind-set is, I think. It could be lost in a single generation.\n\n\n\nBy 8:18 *p.m.*{: .small}, per the Internet, with only one per cent of precincts reporting, it’s over: Trump wins, Clinton wins. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b66e61f743c6ee49a55c0]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nEven though their votes now seem technically meaningless, there is no mass exodus. The people just keep coming. They’ve raced over from work, weary kids trudging along beside them. They are fantastically old people; people in terrible health, in wheelchairs or hobbling along on walkers, or joining me on my bench to stretch out a stiff leg or adjust a bad back. What makes them do it? Keep standing in line, after dark, at the end of a long day, to vote in an election that is already over?\n\n\n\nA young woman says, cheerfully, to her toddler, “Don’t hit yourself. You only have one face, one head. That carries your brain. Which is very important.”\n\n\n\n“After all these many years, in the back of my head,” a man says thoughtfully, “I still hear this voice: ‘Wait until your father gets home.’ And that’s my mom’s voice.”\n\n\n\nAt 9:50 *p.m.*{: .small}, the last person in line disappears inside.\n\n\n\nI am joined by a trans woman about my age. People get afraid, she tells me, and nobody wants to feel afraid. But if you get angry, you feel empowered. Trump is playing on people’s fears, to get them angry, which in turn makes _us_, on the other side, feel fearful. It’s a domino effect. And, she says, it will continue even if Trump is out of the equation.\n\n\n\nAnother trans woman, apparently a stranger to the first, comes out of the church, holding a journal.\n\n\n\n“All I have to write in here,” she says, “is: I voted from Hell.”\n\n\n\nThe last fifty or so voters are still visible inside: patient, calm, plodding forward a few steps at a time.\n\n\n\nMailer described what he called democracy’s “terrifying premise” this way: “Let the passions and cupidities and dreams and kinks and ideals and greed and hopes and foul corruptions of all men and women have their day and the world will still be better off, for there is more good than bad in the sum of us and our workings.”\n\n\n\nWell, we’ll see.\n\n\n\nFrom the beginning, America has been of two minds about the Other. One mind says, Be suspicious of it, dominate it, deport it, exploit it, enslave it, kill it as needed. The other mind denies that there can be any such thing as the Other, in the face of the claim that all are created equal.\n\n\n\nThe first mind has always held violence nearby, to use as needed, and that violence has infused everything we do—our entertainments, our sex, our schools, our ads, our jokes, our view of the earth itself, somehow even our food. It sends our young people abroad in heavy armor, fills public spaces with gunshots, drives people quietly insane in their homes.\n\n\n\nAnd here it comes again, that brittle frontier spirit, that lone lean guy in our heads, with a gun and a fear of encroachment. But he’s picked up a few tricks along the way, has learned to come at us in a form we know and have forgotten to be suspicious of, from TV: famous, likably cranky, a fan of winning by any means necessary, exploiting our recent dullness and our aversion to calling stupidity stupidity, lest we seem too precious.\n\n\n\n“*Donald J Trump a Guardian Angel from Heaven,*{: .small}” reads a poster I retrieved from the floor of the Rothschild rally. “*His Spirit and Hard Work as President Will Make the People and America Great Again*{: .small}!!!”\n\n\n\nAlthough, to me, Trump seems the very opposite of a guardian angel, I thank him for this: I’ve never before imagined America as fragile, as an experiment that could, within my very lifetime, fail.\n\n\n\nBut I imagine it that way now. ♦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/george-saunders-goes-to-trump-rallies","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016

What if her strategy had been more aggressive? What if she’d campaigned more in Wisconsin? What if she'd added Bernie Sanders to her ticket—or what if Sanders had won the nomination to begin with? What if the media had covered Donald Trump differently? What if? What if? When we think back and try to answer those questions, we’re thinking about building alternate histories based on the notion that we can somehow, miraculously, go back in time and do it all over.\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking about time travel may seem like something humans have been doing since the first caveman dropped the first rock on his foot. But, even to begin to imagine the possibility of time travel, your mind must be able to wrap itself around the notion of a past and a future. Otherwise, where would you be travelling, exactly? In his new book, “Time Travel,” James Gleick argues that before the invention of the printing press, less than six hundred years ago, notions of any sort of temporal dislocation were next to impossible; people saw the future as relatively similar to the past—large changes over time simply weren’t visible or accessible. We could travel over geographical distances, exploring unknown lands, but the [exploration of time](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/the-secret-life-of-time) wasn’t on anyone’s mind. The furthest people went was to seek a personal prophecy. But that didn’t involve a vision of time travel so much as a desire to know what lay in store for you, personally; for the world at large, well, what you saw was what you got, now and forever.\n\n\n\nAfter Gutenberg’s invention, the world changed: “Saving our cultural memory in something visible, tangible, and shareable,” Gleick writes. Now that the past could be recorded and accessed at will, it became much easier to understand that some sort of forward trajectory was possible. That view was cemented by the Industrial Revolution—when people could see just how different the world looked from how it had a decade earlier. “Before futurism could be born, people had to _believe_ in progress,” Gleick writes. The first real time traveller, as we understand the notion today, H. G. Wells’s creatively named Time Traveller, appeared in 1895. (Gleick dismisses examples like Rip Van Winkle as mere precursors: they didn’t _travel_, actively; they slept, and time passed.)\n\n\n\nBefore long, it was difficult to imagine an existence in which the idea of travelling through time _didn’t_ exist. It quickly permeated science, with Einstein’s theory of relativity and notions of how to surpass the speed of light; found its way into literature, with Virginia Woolf’s “stretching and warping” of time; and seeped into popular culture, with vanity exercises in building time capsules. Why did time travel become so central, so quickly? Part of the answer is surely that the most central part of time travel is the one we carry with us, always: our memory. For what is remembering something but travelling through time? Once the notion of time travel starts to come naturally to the human mind, it is supremely easy to assimilate it into our mode of thinking. We don’t have to do any mental calisthenics to fathom how it could come to pass. Memory enables personal time travel immediately. If you have no notion of the passage of time, you cannot project yourself to a future point in it. In recent years, it has become clear that the centrality of memory is even more extreme: the very way our memory works allows us to imagine different futures, not just recall what has taken place. Memory is the very stuff of time travel.\n\n\n\nTime travel is as much a cultural staple now as it has ever been. It’s fodder for countless movies—as many people noted, “Back to the Future Part II” predicted the [World Series victory](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/back-future-screenwriter-bob-gale-happy-cubs-but-bummed-a-good-joke-is-spoiled-944076) of the Cubs and the [rise of Trump](http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2015/10/21/believe-back-future-predicted-trumps-run/74359844/). And it has become increasingly incorporated into research areas that are far removed from the physics where it originated. As psychologists study the workings of the human mind and memory, time travel has become a common element.\n\n\n\nFor some time, scientists have known that memory is [anything but](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/idea-happened-memory-recollection) precise. It doesn’t record the past accurately, and it plays tricks on us. For decades, this was seen as a kind of design flaw. Now some researchers suspect that the fallibility of memory isn’t necessarily a quirk or negative side effect of neural wiring but a necessity for being able to imagine the future. At Harvard, Daniel Schacter, a psychologist who studies memory, proposes that thinking about the past is absolutely necessary for imagining the future. “Imagining the future depends on much of the same neural machinery that is needed for remembering the past,” he [writes](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v8/n9/full/nrn2213.html). What’s more, the fact that the past is flexible—that our memory “sins,” to [borrow](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Sins-Memory-Forgets-Remembers/dp/0618219196) a word from Schacter’s writing—is what allows us to imagine things that have never happened. We recombine elements from what we recall into memories that have never taken place. The future is based on a realignment of what we know, not a straightforward recapitulation of it. Schacter calls this the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis. If our memory is too fixed, we cannot flexibly recombine elements. “Think of the brain as a fundamentally prospective organ that is designed to use information from the past and the present to generate predictions about the future,” he explains.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Schacter’s own work and [contributions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26296194) from other laboratories suggest that people with amnesia aren’t able to do the most rudimentary exercises in future projection. One [early patient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15769487), K.C., was found to be incapable of coming up with a single thing that might possibly happen to him in the future. Absent the ability to recollect episodes from his own life, he lost the ability to imagine future episodes that might take place. Not only is the past of a person with no memory inaccessible; his ability to think about the future is imperilled. Time travel, then, is ultimately—and paradoxically—an exercise in remembering. And without that capacity it simply cannot exist.\n\n\n\nClive Wearing was a prominent musician who, in 1985, lost his ability to remember. As far as he was concerned, only the last few seconds of any given day had actually happened. “It was as if every waking moment was the first waking moment,” his wife wrote. His journal forms a poignant narrative of his condition—variations of “I am awake” written every few minutes, and then just as assiduously crossed out and replaced by “this time properly awake” or “awoke for the first time, despite my previous claims.” It’s as profound a testament as ever to the power—and terror—of the present moment, amplified by the absence of memory. This is it: right now is forever. The feeling is pressing enough that it must be noted and catalogued. “To imagine the future was no more possible for Clive than to remember the past,” Oliver Sacks wrote in [his Profile of Wearing](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/09/24/the-abyss) for this magazine, in 2007.\n\n\n\nWearing’s amnesia came with benefits: he truly lived in the present moment. As Sacks points out, every moment was to him a new gift; every meeting with his wife, a revelation; every piece of good news, a source of incomparable joy. But he was forever stuck in the pre-time-travel era—and for him even the time travel of imagination was not possible. And that is a tragedy in its own right. Early in his book, Gleick explores one of the earliest conceptions of time travel, the Universe Rigid—a four-dimensional construct thought up by Wells. It’s a model of the world with time already built in, and so it is unchanging: past, present, and future all exist at once. “The Universe Rigid is a prison,” Gleick writes. “Only the Time Traveller can call himself free.” Without mental time travel, without a conception of the past, we remain, like Wearing, prisoners.\n\n\n\nGleick is not a believer in the feasibility of actual time travel, now or ever. “It does not exist. It cannot,” he writes. We cannot go back in time and change how Clinton approached the election. All we can do is learn from what happened, and wait for the chance to do it better. As the author Israel Zangwill put it, “There is no getting into the future, except by waiting.” Our memory is and always will be as good as time travel gets, and in the meantime time will do the travelling for us. Perhaps that’s not altogether a bad thing. Wells, the original time-travel creator, was disappointed by the future when it came, “as a child finding lumps of coal in the Christmas stocking.” It couldn’t compete with what he had imagined. Reality is no match for imagination—and our current reality has made that point all too clearly.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-to-build-a-time-machine","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Psychology","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5c2e1c8d36cecf40192141fb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8d36cecf40192141fb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Time Travel","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"time-travel"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Time Travel","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"time-travel"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"},{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

He was left with a memory span of only seconds—the most devastating case of amnesia ever recorded. New events and experiences were effaced almost instantly. As his wife, Deborah, wrote in her 2005 memoir, “Forever Today”:   \n> \n> \n> His ability to perceive what he saw and heard was unimpaired. But he did not seem to be able to retain any impression of anything for more than a blink. Indeed, if he did blink, his eyelids parted to reveal a new scene. The view before the blink was utterly forgotten. Each blink, each glance away and back, brought him an entirely new view. I tried to imagine how it was for him. . . . Something akin to a film with bad continuity, the glass half empty, then full, the cigarette suddenly longer, the actor’s hair now tousled, now smooth. But this was real life, a room changing in ways that were physically impossible. \n\nIn addition to this inability to preserve new memories, Clive had a retrograde amnesia, a deletion of virtually his entire past. \n\nWhen he was filmed in 1986 for Jonathan Miller’s extraordinary documentary “Prisoner of Consciousness,” Clive showed a desperate aloneness, fear, and bewilderment. He was acutely, continually, agonizingly conscious that something bizarre, something awful, was the matter. His constantly repeated complaint, however, was not of a faulty memory but of being deprived, in some uncanny and terrible way, of all experience, deprived of consciousness and life itself. As Deborah wrote: > \n> \n> It was as if every waking moment was the first waking moment. Clive was under the constant impression that he had just emerged from unconsciousness because he had no evidence in his own mind of ever being awake before. . . . “I haven’t heard anything, seen anything, touched anything, smelled anything,” he would say. “It’s like being dead.” \n\nDesperate to hold on to something, to gain some purchase, Clive started to keep a journal, first on scraps of paper, then in a notebook. But his journal entries consisted, essentially, of the statements “I am awake” or “I am conscious,” entered again and again every few minutes. He would write: “2:10 *P.M*{: .small}: This time properly awake. . . . 2:14 *P.M*{: .small}: this time finally awake. . . . 2:35 *P.M*{: .small}: this time completely awake,” along with negations of these statements: “At 9:40 *P.M.*{: .small} I awoke for the first time, despite my previous claims.” This in turn was crossed out, followed by “I was fully conscious at 10:35 *P.M.*{: .small}, and awake for the first time in many, many weeks.” This in turn was cancelled out by the next entry.\n\nThis dreadful journal, almost void of any other content but these passionate assertions and denials, intending to affirm existence and continuity but forever contradicting them, was filled anew each day, and soon mounted to hundreds of almost identical pages. It was a terrifying and poignant testament to Clive’s mental state, his lostness, in the years that followed his amnesia—a state that Deborah, in Miller’s film, called “a never-ending agony.” \n\nAnother profoundly amnesic patient I knew some years ago dealt with his abysses of amnesia by fluent confabulations. He was wholly immersed in his quick-fire inventions and had no insight into what was happening; so far as he was concerned, there was nothing the matter. He would confidently identify or misidentify me as a friend of his, a customer in his delicatessen, a kosher butcher, another doctor—as a dozen different people in the course of a few minutes. This sort of confabulation was not one of conscious fabrication. It was, rather, a strategy, a desperate attempt—unconscious and almost automatic—to provide a sort of continuity, a narrative continuity, when memory, and thus experience, was being snatched away every instant. \n\nThough one cannot have direct knowledge of one’s own amnesia, there may be ways to infer it: from the expressions on people’s faces when one has repeated something half a dozen times; when one looks down at one’s coffee cup and finds that it is empty; when one looks at one’s diary and sees entries in one’s own handwriting. Lacking memory, lacking direct experiential knowledge, amnesiacs have to make hypotheses and inferences, and they usually make plausible ones. They can infer that they have been doing _something,_ been _somewhere_, even though they cannot recollect what or where. Yet Clive, rather than making plausible guesses, always came to the conclusion that he had just been “awakened,” that he had been “dead.” This seemed to me a reflection of the almost instantaneous effacement of perception for Clive—thought itself was almost impossible within this tiny window of time. Indeed, Clive once said to Deborah, “I am completely incapable of thinking.” At the beginning of his illness, Clive would sometimes be confounded at the bizarre things he experienced. Deborah wrote of how, coming in one day, she saw him   \n> \n> \n> holding something in the palm of one hand, and repeatedly covering and uncovering it with the other hand as if he were a magician practising a disappearing trick. He was holding a chocolate. He could feel the chocolate unmoving in his left palm, and yet every time he lifted his hand he told me it revealed a brand new chocolate. > \n> \n> “Look!” he said. “It’s new!” He couldn’t take his eyes off it. \n> \n> “It’s the same chocolate,” I said gently. \n> \n> “No . . . look! It’s changed. It wasn’t like that before . . .” He covered and uncovered the chocolate every couple of seconds, lifting and looking. \n> \n> “Look! It’s different again! How do they do it?” \n\nWithin months, Clive’s confusion gave way to the agony, the desperation, that is so clear in Miller’s film. This, in turn, was succeeded by a deep depression, as it came to him—if only in sudden, intense, and immediately forgotten moments—that his former life was over, that he was incorrigibly disabled. \n\nAs the months passed without any real improvement, the hope of significant recovery became fainter and fainter, and toward the end of 1985 Clive was moved to a room in a chronic psychiatric unit—a room he was to occupy for the next six and a half years but which he was never able to recognize as his own. A young psychologist saw Clive for a period of time in 1990 and kept a verbatim record of everything he said, and this caught the grim mood that had taken hold. Clive said at one point, “Can you imagine one night five years long? No dreaming, no waking, no touch, no taste, no smell, no sight, no sound, no hearing, nothing at all. It’s like being dead. I came to the conclusion that I was dead.” \n\nThe only times of feeling alive were when Deborah visited him. But the moment she left, he was desperate once again, and by the time she got home, ten or fifteen minutes later, she would find repeated messages from him on her answering machine: “Please come and see me, darling—it’s been ages since I’ve seen you. Please fly here at the speed of light.” \n\nTo imagine the future was no more possible for Clive than to remember the past—both were engulfed by the onslaught of amnesia. Yet, at some level, Clive could not be unaware of the sort of place he was in, and the likelihood that he would spend the rest of his life, his endless night, in such a place. \n\nBut then, seven years after his illness, after huge efforts by Deborah, Clive was moved to a small country residence for the brain-injured, much more congenial than a hospital. Here he was one of only a handful of patients, and in constant contact with a dedicated staff who treated him as an individual and respected his intelligence and talents. He was taken off most of his heavy tranquillizers, and seemed to enjoy his walks around the village and gardens near the home, the spaciousness, the fresh food. \n\nFor the first eight or nine years in this new home, Deborah told me, “Clive was calmer and sometimes jolly, a bit more content, but often with angry outbursts still, unpredictable, withdrawn, spending most of his time in his room alone.” But gradually, in the past six or seven years, Clive has become more sociable, more talkative. Conversation (though of a “scripted” sort) has come to fill what had been empty, solitary, and desperate days. \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThough I had corresponded with Deborah since Clive first became ill, twenty years went by before I met Clive in person. He was so changed from the haunted, agonized man I had seen in Miller’s 1986 film that I was scarcely prepared for the dapper, bubbling figure who opened the door when Deborah and I went to visit him in the summer of 2005. He had been reminded of our visit just before we arrived, and he flung his arms around Deborah the moment she entered. \n\n\n\nDeborah introduced me: “This is Dr. Sacks.” And Clive immediately said, “You doctors work twenty-four hours a day, don’t you? You’re always in demand.” We went up to his room, which contained an electric organ console and a piano piled high with music. Some of the scores, I noted, were transcriptions of Orlandus Lassus, the Renaissance composer whose works Clive had edited. I saw Clive’s journal by the washstand—he has now filled up scores of volumes, and the current one is always kept in this exact location. Next to it was an etymological dictionary with dozens of reference slips of different colors stuck between the pages and a large, handsome volume, “The 100 Most Beautiful Cathedrals in the World.” A Canaletto print hung on the wall, and I asked Clive if he had ever been to Venice. No, he said. (Deborah told me they had visited several times before his illness.) Looking at the print, Clive pointed out the dome of a church: “Look at it,” he said. “See how it soars—like an angel!” \n\nWhen I asked Deborah whether Clive knew about her memoir, she told me that she had shown it to him twice before, but that he had instantly forgotten. I had my own heavily annotated copy with me, and asked Deborah to show it to him again.\n\n“You’ve written a book!” he cried, astonished. “Well done! Congratulations!” He peered at the cover. “All by you? Good heavens!” Excited, he jumped for joy. Deborah showed him the dedication page: “For my Clive.” “Dedicated to me?” He hugged her. This scene was repeated several times within a few minutes, with almost exactly the same astonishment, the same expressions of delight and joy each time. \n\nClive and Deborah are still very much in love with each other, despite his amnesia. (Indeed, Deborah’s book is subtitled “A Memoir of Love and Amnesia.”) He greeted her several times as if she had just arrived. It must be an extraordinary situation, I thought, both maddening and flattering, to be seen always as new, as a gift, a blessing. \n\nClive had, in the meantime, addressed me as “Your Highness” and inquired at intervals, “Been at Buckingham Palace? . . . Are you the Prime Minister? . . . Are you from the U.N.?” He laughed when I answered, “Just the U.S.” This joking or jesting was of a somewhat waggish, stereotyped nature and highly repetitive. Clive had no idea who I was, little idea who anyone was, but this bonhomie allowed him to make contact, to keep a conversation going. I suspected he had some damage to his frontal lobes, too—such jokiness (neurologists speak of _Witzelsucht,_ joking disease), like his impulsiveness and chattiness, could go with a weakening of the usual social frontal-lobe inhibitions. \n\nHe was excited at the notion of going out for lunch—lunch with Deborah. “Isn’t she a wonderful woman?” he kept asking me. “Doesn’t she have marvellous kisses?” I said yes, I was sure she had. \n\nAs we drove to the restaurant, Clive, with great speed and fluency, invented words for the letters on the license plates of passing cars: “JCK” was Japanese Clever Kid; “NKR” was New King of Russia; and “BDH” (Deborah’s car) was British Daft Hospital, then Blessed Dutch Hospital. “Forever Today_,”_ Deborah’s book, immediately became “Three-Ever Today,” “Two-Ever Today,” “One-Ever Today.” This incontinent punning and rhyming and clanging was virtually instantaneous, occurring with a speed no normal person could match. It resembled Tourettic or savantlike speed, the speed of the preconscious, undelayed by reflection. \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, Clive did all the license plates in the parking lot and then, elaborately, with a bow and a flourish, let Deborah enter: “Ladies first!” He looked at me with some uncertainty as I followed them to the table: “Are you joining us, too?” \n\nWhen I offered him the wine list, he looked it over and exclaimed, “Good God! Australian wine! New Zealand wine! The colonies are producing something original—how exciting!” This partly indicated his retrograde amnesia—he is still in the nineteen-sixties (if he is anywhere), when Australian and New Zealand wines were almost unheard of in England. “The colonies,” however, was part of his compulsive waggery and parody. \n\nAt lunch he talked about Cambridge—he had been at Clare College, but had often gone next door to King’s, for its famous choir. He spoke of how after Cambridge, in 1968, he joined the London Sinfonietta, where they played modern music, though he was already attracted to the Renaissance and Lassus. He was the chorus master there, and he reminisced about how the singers could not talk during coffee breaks; they had to save their voices (“It was often misunderstood by the instrumentalists, seemed standoffish to them”). These all sounded like genuine memories. But they could equally have reflected his knowing _about_ these events, rather than actual memories of them—expressions of “semantic” memory rather than “event” or “episodic” memory. Then he spoke of the Second World War (he was born in 1938) and how his family would go to bomb shelters and play chess or cards there. He said that he remembered the doodlebugs: “There were more bombs in Birmingham than in London.” Was it possible that these were genuine memories? He would have been only six or seven, at most. Or was he confabulating or simply, as we all do, repeating stories he had been told as a child? \n\nAt one point, he talked about pollution and how dirty petrol engines were. When I told him I had a hybrid with an electric motor as well as a combustion engine, he was astounded, as if something he had read about as a theoretical possibility had, far sooner than he had imagined, become a reality. \n\nIn her remarkable book, so tender yet so tough-minded and realistic, Deborah wrote about the change that had so struck me: that Clive was now “garrulous and outgoing . . . could talk the hind legs off a donkey.” There were certain themes he tended to stick to, she said, favorite subjects (electricity, the Tube, stars and planets, Queen Victoria, words and etymologies), which would all be brought up again and again: > \n> \n> “Have they found life on Mars yet?” \n> \n> “No, darling, but they think there might have been water . . .” \n> \n> “Really? Isn’t it amazing that the sun goes on burning? Where does it get all that fuel? It doesn’t get any smaller. And it doesn’t move. We move round the sun. How can it keep on burning for millions of years? And the Earth stays the same temperature. It’s so finely balanced.” \n> \n> “They say it’s getting warmer now, love. They call it global warming.” \n> \n> “No! Why’s that?” \n> \n> “Because of the pollution. We’ve been emitting gases into the atmosphere. And puncturing the ozone layer.” \n> \n> “*OH NO*{: .small}! That could be disastrous!”\n> \n> “People are already getting more cancers.” \n> \n> “Oh, aren’t people stupid! Do you know the average IQ is only 100? That’s terribly low, isn’t it? One hundred. It’s no wonder the world’s in such a mess.” \n> \n> Clive’s scripts were repeated with great frequency, sometimes three or four times in one phone call. He stuck to subjects he felt he knew something about, where he would be on safe ground, even if here and there something apocryphal crept in. . . . These small areas of repartee acted as stepping stones on which he could move through the present. They enabled him to engage with others. \n\nI would put it even more strongly and use a phrase that Deborah used in another connection, when she wrote of Clive being poised upon “a tiny platform . . . above the abyss.” Clive’s loquacity, his almost compulsive need to talk and keep conversations going, served to maintain a precarious platform, and when he came to a stop the abyss was there, waiting to engulf him. This, indeed, is what happened when we went to a supermarket and he and I got separated briefly from Deborah. He suddenly exclaimed, “I’m conscious now . . . . Never saw a human being before . . . for thirty years . . . . It’s like death!” He looked very angry and distressed. Deborah said the staff calls these grim monologues his “deads”—they make a note of how many he has in a day or a week and gauge his state of mind by their number. \n\nDeborah thinks that repetition has slightly dulled the very real pain that goes with this agonized but stereotyped complaint, but when he says such things she will distract him immediately. Once she has done this, there seems to be no lingering mood—an advantage of his amnesia. And, indeed, once we returned to the car Clive was off on his license plates again. \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nBack in his room, I spotted the two volumes of Bach’s “Forty-eight Preludes and Fugues” on top of the piano and asked Clive if he would play one of them. He said that he had never played any of them before, but then he began to play Prelude 9 in E Major and said, “I remember this one.” He remembers almost nothing unless he is actually doing it; then it may come to him. He inserted a tiny, charming improvisation at one point, and did a sort of Chico Marx ending, with a huge downward scale. With his great musicality and his playfulness, he can easily improvise, joke, play with any piece of music. \n\n\n\nHis eye fell on the book about cathedrals, and he talked about cathedral bells—did I know how many combinations there could be with eight bells? “Eight by seven by six by five by four by three by two by one,” he rattled off. “Factorial eight.” And then, without pause: “That’s forty thousand.” (I worked it out, laboriously: it is 40,320.) \n\nI asked him about Prime Ministers. Tony Blair? Never heard of him. John Major? No. Margaret Thatcher? Vaguely familiar. Harold Macmillan, Harold Wilson: ditto. (But earlier in the day he had seen a car with “JMV” plates and instantly said, “John Major Vehicle”—showing that he had an _implicit_ memory of Major’s name.) Deborah wrote of how he could not remember _her_ name, “but one day someone asked him to say his full name, and he said, ‘Clive David Deborah Wearing—funny name that. I don’t know why my parents called me that.’ ” He has gained other implicit memories, too, slowly picking up new knowledge, like the layout of his residence. He can go alone now to the bathroom, the dining room, the kitchen—but if he stops and thinks en route he is lost. Though he could not describe his residence, Deborah tells me that he unclasps his seat belt as they draw near and offers to get out and open the gate. Later, when he makes her coffee, he knows where the cups, the milk, and the sugar are kept. He cannot _say_ where they are, but he can go to them; he has actions, but few facts, at his disposal. \n\nI decided to widen the testing and asked Clive to tell me the names of all the composers he knew. He said, “Handel, Bach, Beethoven, Berg, Mozart, Lassus.” That was it. Deborah told me that at first, when asked this question, he would omit Lassus, his favorite composer. This seemed appalling for someone who had been not only a musician but an encyclopedic musicologist. Perhaps it reflected the shortness of his attention span and recent immediate memory—perhaps he thought that he had in fact given us dozens of names. So I asked him other questions on a variety of topics that he would have been knowledgeable about in his earlier days. Again, there was a paucity of information in his replies and sometimes something close to a blank. I started to feel that I had been beguiled, in a sense, by Clive’s easy, nonchalant, fluent conversation into thinking that he still had a great deal of general information at his disposal, despite the loss of memory for events. Given his intelligence, ingenuity, and humor, it was easy to think this on meeting him for the first time. But repeated conversations rapidly exposed the limits of his knowledge. It was indeed as Deborah wrote in her book, Clive “stuck to subjects he knew something about” and used these islands of knowledge as “stepping stones” in his conversation. Clearly, Clive’s general knowledge, or semantic memory, was greatly affected, too—though not as catastrophically as his episodic memory. \n\nYet semantic memory of this sort, even if completely intact, is not of much use in the absence of explicit, episodic memory. Clive is safe enough in the confines of his residence, for instance, but he would be hopelessly lost if he were to go out alone. Lawrence Weiskrantz comments on the need for both sorts of memory in his 1997 book “Consciousness Lost and Found”: > \n> \n> The amnesic patient can think about material in the immediate present. . . . He can also think about items in his semantic memory, his general knowledge. . . . But thinking for successful everyday adaptation requires not only factual knowledge, but the ability to recall it on the right occasion, to relate it to other occasions, indeed the ability to reminisce. \n\nThis uselessness of semantic memory unaccompanied by episodic memory is also brought out by Umberto Eco in his novel “The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana_,”_ in which the narrator, an antiquarian bookseller and polymath, is a man of Eco-like intelligence and erudition. Though amnesic from a stroke, he retains the poetry he has read, the many languages he knows, his encyclopedic memory of facts; but he is nonetheless helpless and disoriented (and recovers from this only because the effects of his stroke are transient).\n\nIt is similar, in a way, with Clive. His semantic memory, while of little help in organizing his life, does have a crucial social role: it allows him to engage in conversation (though it is occasionally more monologue than conversation). Thus, Deborah wrote, “he would string all his subjects together in a row, and the other person simply needed to nod or mumble.” By moving rapidly from one thought to another, Clive managed to secure a sort of continuity, to hold the thread of consciousness and attention intact—albeit precariously, for the thoughts were held together, on the whole, by superficial associations. Clive’s verbosity made him a little odd, a little too much at times, but it was highly adaptive—it enabled him to reënter the world of human discourse. \n\nIn the 1986 film, Deborah quoted Proust’s description of Swann waking from a deep sleep, not knowing at first where he was, who he was, what he was. He had only “the most rudimentary sense of existence, such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an animal’s consciousness,” until memory came back to him, “like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out of the abyss of not-being, from which I could never have escaped by myself.” This gave him back his personal consciousness and identity. No rope from Heaven, no autobiographical memory will ever come down in this way to Clive. F rom the start there have been, for Clive, two realities of immense importance. The first of these is Deborah, whose presence and love for him have made life tolerable, at least intermittently, in the twenty or more years since his illness. Clive’s amnesia not only destroyed his ability to retain new memories; it deleted almost all of his earlier memories, including those of the years when he met and fell in love with Deborah. He told Deborah, when she questioned him, that he had never heard of John Lennon or John F. Kennedy. Though he always recognized his own children, Deborah told me, “he would be surprised at their height and amazed to hear he is a grandfather. He asked his younger son what O-level exams he was doing in 2005, more than twenty years after Edmund left school.” Yet somehow he always recognized Deborah as his wife, when she visited, and felt moored by her presence, lost without her. He would rush to the door when he heard her voice, and embrace her with passionate, desperate fervor. Having no idea how long she had been away—since anything not in his immediate field of perception and attention would be lost, forgotten, within seconds—he seemed to feel that she, too, had been lost in the abyss of time, and so her “return” from the abyss seemed nothing short of miraculous. As Deborah put it:   \n> \n> \n> Clive was constantly surrounded by strangers in a strange place, with no knowledge of where he was or what had happened to him. To catch sight of me was always a massive relief—to know that he was not alone, that I still cared, that I loved him, that I was there. Clive was terrified all the time. But I was his life, I was his lifeline. Every time he saw me, he would run to me, fall on me, sobbing, clinging. \n\nHow, why, when he recognized no one else with any consistency, did Clive recognize Deborah? There are clearly many sorts of memory, and emotional memory is one of the deepest and least understood. \n\nThe neuroscientist Neal J. Cohen recounts the famous story of Édouard Claparède, a Swiss physician who, upon shaking hands with a severely amnesic woman,> \n> \n> pricked her finger with a pin hidden in his hand. Subsequently, whenever he again attempted to shake the patient’s hand, she promptly withdrew it. When he questioned her about this behavior, she replied, “Isn’t it allowed to withdraw one’s hand?” and “Perhaps there is a pin hidden in your hand,” and finally, “Sometimes pins are hidden in hands.” Thus the patient learned the appropriate response based on previous experience, but she never seemed to attribute her behavior to the personal memory of some previously experienced event. \n\nFor Claparède’s patient, some sort of memory of the pain, an implicit and emotional memory, persisted. It seems certain, likewise, that in the first two years of life, even though one retains no explicit memories (Freud called this infantile amnesia), deep emotional memories or associations are nevertheless being made in the limbic system and other regions of the brain where emotions are represented—and these emotional memories may determine one’s behavior for a lifetime. A recent paper by Oliver Turnbull, Evangelos Zois, et al., in the journal _Neuro-Psychoanalysis,_ has shown that patients with amnesia can form emotional transferences to an analyst, even though they retain no explicit memory of the analyst or their previous meetings. Nonetheless, a strong emotional bond begins to develop. Clive and Deborah were newly married at the time of his encephalitis, and deeply in love for a few years before that. His passionate relationship with her, a relationship that began before his encephalitis, and one that centers in part on their shared love for music, has engraved itself in him—in areas of his brain unaffected by the encephalitis—so deeply that his amnesia, the most severe amnesia ever recorded, cannot eradicate it. \n\nNonetheless, for many years he failed to recognize Deborah if she chanced to walk past, and even now he cannot say what she looks like unless he is actually looking at her. Her appearance, her voice, her scent, the way they behave with each other, and the intensity of their emotions and interactions—all this confirms her identity, and his own. \n\nThe other miracle was the discovery Deborah made early on, while Clive was still in the hospital, desperately confused and disoriented: that his musical powers were totally intact. “I picked up some music,” Deborah wrote, > \n> \n> and held it open for Clive to see. I started to sing one of the lines. He picked up the tenor lines and sang with me. A bar or so in, I suddenly realized what was happening. He could still read music. He was singing. His talk might be a jumble no one could understand but his brain was still capable of music. . . . When he got to the end of the line I hugged him and kissed him all over his face. . . . Clive could sit down at the organ and play with both hands on the keyboard, changing stops, and with his feet on the pedals, as if this were easier than riding a bicycle. Suddenly we had a place to be together, where we could create our own world away from the ward. Our friends came in to sing. I left a pile of music by the bed and visitors brought other pieces. \n\nMiller’s film showed dramatically the virtually perfect preservation of Clive’s musical powers and memory. In these scenes from only a year or so after his illness, his face often appeared tight with torment and bewilderment. But when he was conducting his old choir, he performed with great sensitivity and grace, mouthing the melodies, turning to different singers and sections of the choir, cuing them, encouraging them, to bring out their special parts. It is obvious that Clive not only knew the piece intimately—how all the parts contributed to the unfolding of the musical thought—but also retained all the skills of conducting, his professional persona, and his own unique style. \n\nClive cannot retain any memory of passing events or experience and, in addition, has lost most of the memories of events and experiences _preceding_ his encephalitis—how, then, does he retain his remarkable knowledge of music, his ability to sight-read, play the piano and organ, sing, and conduct a choir in the masterly way he did before he became ill? \n\nH.M., a famous and unfortunate patient described by Scoville and Milner in 1957, was rendered amnesic by the surgical removal of both hippocampi, along with adjacent structures of the medial temporal lobes. (This was a desperate attempt at treating his intractable seizures; it was not yet realized that autobiographical memory and the ability to form new memories of events depended on these structures.) Yet H.M., though he lost many memories of his former life, did not lose any of the skills he had acquired, and indeed he could learn and perfect _new_ skills with training and practice, even though he would retain no memory of the practice sessions. \n\nLarry Squire, a neuroscientist who has spent a lifetime exploring mechanisms of memory and amnesia, emphasizes that no two cases of amnesia are the same. He wrote to me:> \n> \n> If the damage is limited to the medial temporal lobe, then one expects an impairment such as H.M. had. With somewhat more extensive medial temporal lobe damage, one can expect something more severe, as in E.P. [a patient whom Squire and his colleagues have investigated intensively]. With the addition of frontal damage, perhaps one begins to understand Clive’s impairment. Or perhaps one needs lateral temporal damage as well, or basal forebrain damage. Clive’s case is unique, because a particular pattern of anatomical damage occurred. His case is not like H.M. or like Claparède’s patient. We cannot write about amnesia as if it were a single entity like mumps or measles. \n\nYet H.M.’s case and subsequent work made it clear that two very different sorts of memory could exist: a conscious memory of events (episodic memory) and an unconscious memory for procedures—and that such procedural memory is unimpaired in amnesia. \n\nThis is dramatically clear with Clive, too, for he can shave, shower, look after his grooming, and dress elegantly, with taste and style; he moves confidently and is fond of dancing. He talks abundantly, using a large vocabulary; he can read and write in several languages. He is good at calculation. He can make phone calls, and he can find the coffee things and find his way about the home. If he is asked how to do these things, he cannot say, but he does them. Whatever involves a sequence or pattern of action, he does fluently, unhesitatingly. \n\nBut can Clive’s beautiful playing and singing, his masterly conducting, his powers of improvisation be adequately characterized as “skills” or “procedures”? For his playing is infused with intelligence and feeling, with a sensitive attunement to the musical structure, the composer’s style and mind. Can any artistic or creative performance of this calibre be adequately explained by “procedural memory”? Episodic or explicit memory, we know, develops relatively late in childhood and is dependent on a complex brain system involving the hippocampi and medial temporal-lobe structures, the system that is compromised in severe amnesiacs and all but obliterated in Clive. The basis of procedural or implicit memory is less easy to define, but it certainly involves larger and more primitive parts of the brain—subcortical structures like the basal ganglia and cerebellum and their many connections to each other and to the cerebral cortex. The size and variety of these systems guarantee the robustness of procedural memory and the fact that, unlike episodic memory, procedural memory can remain largely intact even in the face of extensive damage to the hippocampi and medial temporal-lobe structures. \n\nEpisodic memory depends on the perception of particular and often unique events, and one’s memories of such events, like one’s original perception of them, are not only highly individual (colored by one’s interests, concerns, and values) but prone to be revised or recategorized every time they are recalled. This is in fundamental contrast to procedural memory, where it is all-important that the remembering be literal, exact, and reproducible. Repetition and rehearsal, timing and sequence are of the essence here. Rodolfo Llinás, the neuroscientist, uses the term “fixed action pattern” (*FAP*{: .small}) for such procedural memories. Some of these may be present even before birth (fetal horses, for example, may gallop in the womb). Much of the early motor development of the child depends on learning and refining such procedures, through play, imitation, trial and error, and incessant rehearsal. All of these start to develop long before the child can call on any explicit or episodic memories. \n\nIs the concept of fixed action patterns any more illuminating than that of procedural memories in relation to the enormously complex, creative performances of a professional musician? In his book “I of the Vortex_,”_ Llinás writes: > \n> \n> When a soloist such as Heifetz plays with a symphony orchestra accompanying him, by convention the concerto is played purely from memory. Such playing implies that this highly specific motor pattern is stored somewhere and subsequently released at the time the curtain goes up. \n\nBut for a performer, Llinás writes, it is not sufficient to have implicit memory only; one must have explicit memory as well: > \n> \n> Without intact explicit memory, Jascha Heifetz would not remember from day to day which piece he had chosen to work on previously, or that he had ever worked on that piece before. Nor would he recall what he had accomplished the day before or by analysis of past experience what particular problems in execution should be a focus of today’s practice session. In fact, it would not occur to him to have a practice session at all; without close direction from someone else he would be effectively incapable of undertaking the process of learning any new piece, irrespective of his considerable technical skills. \n\nThis, too, is very much the case with Clive, who, for all his musical powers, needs “close direction” from others. He needs someone to put the music before him, to get him into action, and to make sure that he learns and practices new pieces. \n\nWhat is the relationship of action patterns and procedural memories, which are associated with relatively primitive portions of the nervous system, to consciousness and sensibility, which depend on the cerebral cortex? Practice involves conscious application, monitoring what one is doing, bringing all one’s intelligence and sensibility and values to bear—even though what is so painfully and consciously acquired may then become automatic, coded in motor patterns at a subcortical level. Each time Clive sings or plays the piano or conducts a choir, automatism comes to his aid. But what happens in an artistic or creative performance, though it depends on automatisms, is anything but automatic. The actual performance reanimates him, engages him as a creative person; it becomes fresh and perhaps contains new improvisations or innovations. Once Clive starts playing, his “momentum,” as Deborah writes, will keep him, and the piece, going. Deborah, herself a musician, expresses this very precisely: > \n> \n> The momentum of the music carried Clive from bar to bar. Within the structure of the piece, he was held, as if the staves were tramlines and there was only one way to go. He knew exactly where he was because in every phrase there is context implied, by rhythm, key, melody. It was marvellous to be free. When the music stopped Clive fell through to the lost place. But for those moments he was playing he seemed normal. \n\nClive’s performance self seems, to those who know him, just as vivid and complete as it was before his illness. This mode of being, this self, is seemingly untouched by his amnesia, even though his autobiographical self, the self that depends on explicit, episodic memories, is virtually lost. The rope that is let down from Heaven for Clive comes not with recalling the past, as for Proust, but with performance—and it holds only as long as the performance lasts. Without performance, the thread is broken, and he is thrown back once again into the abyss. \n\nDeborah speaks of the “momentum” of the music in its very structure. A piece of music is not a mere sequence of notes but a tightly organized organic whole. Every bar, every phrase arises organically from what preceded it and points to what will follow. Dynamism is built into the nature of melody. And over and above this there is the intentionality of the composer, the style, the order, and the logic that he has created to express his musical ideas and feelings. These, too, are present in every bar and phrase. Schopenhauer wrote of melody as having “significant intentional connection from beginning to end” and as “one thought from beginning to end.” Marvin Minsky compares a sonata to a teacher or a lesson: > \n> \n> No one remembers, word for word, all that was said in any lecture, or played in any piece. But if you understood it once, you now own new networks of knowledge, about each theme and how it changes and relates to others. Thus, no one could remember Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony entire, from a single hearing. But neither could one ever hear again those first four notes as just four notes! Once but a tiny scrap of sound; it is now a Known Thing—a locus in the web of all the other things we know, whose meanings and significances depend on one another. \n\nA piece of music will draw one in, teach one about its structure and secrets, whether one is listening consciously or not. This is so even if one has never heard a piece of music before. Listening to music is not a passive process but intensely active, involving a stream of inferences, hypotheses, expectations, and anticipations. We can grasp a new piece—how it is constructed, where it is going, what will come next—with such accuracy that even after a few bars we may be able to hum or sing along with it. Such anticipation, such singing along, is possible because one has knowledge, largely implicit, of musical “rules” (how a cadence must resolve, for instance) and a familiarity with particular musical conventions (the form of a sonata, or the repetition of a theme). When we “remember” a melody, it plays in our mind; it becomes newly alive.\n\nThus we can listen again and again to a recording of a piece of music, a piece we know well, and yet it can seem as fresh, as new, as the first time we heard it. There is not a process of recalling, assembling, recategorizing, as when one attempts to reconstruct or remember an event or a scene from the past. We recall one tone at a time, and each tone entirely fills our consciousness yet simultaneously relates to the whole. It is similar when we walk or run or swim—we do so one step, one stroke at a time, yet each step or stroke is an integral part of the whole. Indeed, if we think of each note or step too consciously, we may lose the thread, the motor melody. \n\nIt may be that Clive, incapable of remembering or anticipating events because of his amnesia, is able to sing and play and conduct music because remembering music is not, in the usual sense, remembering at all. Remembering music, listening to it, or playing it, is wholly in the present. Victor Zuckerkandl, a philosopher of music, explored this paradox beautifully in 1956 in “Sound and Symbol”: > \n> \n> The hearing of a melody is a hearing _with_ the melody. . . . It is even a condition of hearing melody that the tone present at the moment should fill consciousness _entirely,_ that _nothing_ should be remembered, nothing except it or beside it be present in consciousness. . . . Hearing a melody is hearing, having heard, and being about to hear, all at once. . . . Every melody declares to us that the past can be there without being remembered, the future without being foreknown. \n\nIt has been twenty years since Clive’s illness, and, for him, nothing has moved on. One might say he is still in 1985 or, given his retrograde amnesia, in 1965. In some ways, he is not anywhere at all; he has dropped out of space and time altogether. He no longer has any inner narrative; he is not leading a life in the sense that the rest of us do. And yet one has only to see him at the keyboard or with Deborah to feel that, at such times, he is himself again and wholly alive. It is not the remembrance of things past, the “once” that Clive yearns for, or can ever achieve. It is the claiming, the filling, of the present, the now, and this is only possible when he is totally immersed in the successive moments of an act.

a species, humans are incredibly smart. We tell stories, create magnificent art and astounding technology, build cities, and explore space. We haven’t been around nearly as long as many other species, but in many respects we’ve accomplished more than any have before us. We eat them and they don’t eat us. We even run scientific studies on them—and are thinking about re-creating some of those that have gone extinct. But our intelligence comes with a curious caveat: our babies are among the dumbest—or, rather, the most helpless—that exist. A baby giraffe can stand within an hour of birth, and can even potentially flee predators on its first day of life. A monkey can grasp its mother and hang on for protection and nourishment. A human infant can’t even hold up its own head.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evolution of human intelligence isn’t something that Celeste Kidd had ever pondered. A developmental cognitive scientist who currently works at the University of Rochester, her work had focussed mostly on learning and decision-making in children. Over years of observing young children, she became impressed with the average child’s level of sophistication. But when she looked at the infants she encountered, she saw a baffling degree of helplessness: How could they be so incompetent one second and so bright so soon thereafter? One day, she posed the question to her colleague Steven Piantadosi. “Both of us wondered what could possibly justify the degree of helplessness human infants exhibit,” she told me recently. “Even other primate babies, like baby chimps, which are close in evolutionary terms, can cling onto their moms.” She began to see a contradiction: humans are born quite helpless, far more so than any other primate, but, fairly early on, we start becoming quite smart, again far more so than any other primate. What if this weren’t a contradiction so much as a causal pathway?\n\n\n\nThat’s the argument that Kidd and Piantadosi make in their [new paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/25/6874.abstract), published in a June issue of _PNAS._ Humans become so intelligent _because_ human infants are so incredibly helpless, they argue; the one necessitates the other. The theory is startling, but it isn’t entirely new. Researchers have been pondering the peculiarities of our birth and its evolutionary significance for quite some time. Humans belong to the subset of mammals, called viviparous mammals, that give live birth to their young. This means that infants must grow to a mature enough state inside the body to be born, but they can’t be so big that they are unable to come out. This leads to a trade-off: the more intelligent an animal is, the larger its head generally is, but the birth canal imposes an upper limit on just how large that head can be before it gets stuck. The brain, therefore, must keep maturing, and the head must continue growing, long after birth. The more intelligent an animal will eventually be, the more relatively immature its brain is at birth.\n\n\n\nResearchers have long known about this trade-off, and about the [connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18380864) between brain size and [neural density](http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(05)00082-3?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661305000823%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) and intelligence. For instance, Robin Dunbar [found](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships) that the ratio of neocortical volume to brain size can predict the social-group size in a number of species, including bats, cetaceans, and primates, while [Simon Reader](http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/reader/) [has](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/7/4436.abstract) [demonstrated](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/7/4141.full) links in tool use and innovation to brain size in primates. Kidd and Piantadosi’s new idea is that increased helplessness in newborns mandates increased intelligence in parents—and that a runaway selection dynamic can account for both. Natural selection favors humans with large brains, because those humans tend to be smarter. This may create evolutionary incentives for babies that are born at an even earlier developmental stage, which require more intelligence to raise. This creates the dynamic: over time, helpless babies make parents more intelligent, which makes babies more helpless, which makes their parents more intelligent, and so on.\n\n\n\nDuring their investigation, Kidd and Piantadosi realized something important that strengthened their theory. It turns out that another variable has an even higher correlation with intelligence than brain size—time to maturity, or weaning time. In other words, the time it takes to shepherd newborns through absolute helplessness to a point of relative self-sufficiency predicts primate intelligence more strongly than the best measure that has previously been proposed, namely, head circumference. Orangutans have smarter babies than baboons and they wean them longer. Baboon babies, in turn, are weaned longer, and are smarter, than lemur babies.\n\n\n\nPutting these facts together helped Kidd and Piantadosi develop their hypothesis. The connection between head size and intelligence does create incentives for babies to arrive earlier. But it’s the connection between weaning time and intelligence that may really be driving the cycle. You need to be smarter to care for more helpless creatures, which means you need a larger brain—which means that babies have to enter the world at an even more helpless stage of development, since there is a finite size to their brain at birth, mandated by the physiology of live birth. And so the cycle continues.\n\n\n\nOf course, the theory is just that—a model. Ideally, to prove it you would look at head size, birth time, and intelligence over the span of human evolution, to see if we were born earlier as we got smarter—data that are unavailable. (Kidd also stresses repeatedly that this theory supplements, but does not supplant, earlier ones: it can coexist quite naturally with both the social-group account of intelligence—the Dunbar approach—and what’s called the metabolic accounts of intelligence, which posits that our [digestive](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1520-6505(2000)9:4%3C156::AID-EVAN5%3E3.0.CO;2-7/abstract) system has [allowed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2744104?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) for our brain’s high metabolic needs, and that we grew smarter to be able to find and share difficult-to-gather food.) But there are some intriguing converging pieces of evidence. For one, other animals that are _not_ viviparous have not evolved the same levels of intelligence, suggesting an inherent link between live birth and brainpower. And in modern humans, a few pieces of evidence appear to suggest that smarter parents are more likely to have offspring that survive. In [one limited sample](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690800041X)—two hundred and twenty-two Serbian Roma women—maternal I.Q. and child mortality were negatively correlated (that is, higher I.Q. meant lower mortality), even controlling for education, age, and a number of other factors. In a [larger sample](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2061300?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) of Californian parents, in 1978, years of education were linked to infant-mortality rates. Global epidemiological studies [suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3070762) a decrease in mortality that equals between seven and nine per cent for each year of a mother’s education. None of this is decisive, of course, but it is suggestive.\n\n\n\nThere is, of course, one follow-up question: Why did this cycle happen to humans and not to lemurs? When I asked Kidd about this, she told me that their theory cannot offer an answer—likely as not, it’s a matter of pure genetic luck that became self-reinforcing. As we grew smarter, we were better able to take care of our infants, so they could be born more helpless and allow us to grow even smarter.\n\n\n\nOne intriguing way to test the hypothesis further: look at twins. Typically, twins are not carried to full term. Does that mean that twins are more intelligent than non-twins, since they require longer weaning time—and would a mother who is a twin, in turn, give birth to smarter children? “It’s a really good question, to look at the types of twins that run in families and whether that leads to higher intelligence,” Kidd said. “It’s a predictable hypothesis,” and one that they may well include in their ongoing research on train heritability in twins. And it’s a hypothesis that came, of all places, from a five-year-old—Kidd was being interviewed about twins for a \n\n+++podcast\n\n[#iframe: http://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=](100%x120)\n\n+++\n\n\n\n----------\n\n(http://www.scienceknocks.com/) by the daughter of Sindya Bhanoo, a former columnist at the _Times_.

But, as has often been reported, the relative increases haven’t been uniform. In 1970, the top ten per cent of the population earned a third of the total national income. By 2012, it earned half. According [to estimates by](http://eml.berkeley.edu/%7Esaez/saez-UStopincomes-2012.pdf) Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, income inequality has grown by record amounts since the 2008 recession: between 2009 and 2012, incomes for the top one per cent of the population rose by more than thirty per cent, while those for the rest of the country—the bottom ninety-nine per cent—increased by less than half of one per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there’s one thing that hasn’t changed all that much: social discontent stemming from rising inequality. This might be somewhat surprising. According to social-science [research](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/9/1095), self-reported happiness traditionally correlates roughly with income inequality: in years when inequality lessens, people report greater life satisfaction. It’s not so much a question of absolute income as one of how unequal the distribution of incomes is. Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan who studies income and happiness, told me that one way to understand it is to imagine him taking a dollar from Bill Gates and giving it to me. “Each extra dollar buys less happiness,” he says, noting that I would get more happiness from that dollar than Gates did. “It’s the basic marginal benefit of each extra dollar. Inequality reduces happiness—every social scientist has a strong presumption of this.”\n\n\n\nSo one might expect to see a rising wave of discontent during the past several years, as inequality has increased sharply. But here’s the strange thing: in polls that have sought to capture that rise directly, not much has changed. That is, people _say_ they’d be happier if there were a more equitable distribution of wealth, but they’ve actually remained just about as happy, even as inequality has gone up. A huge sense of national frustration did, of course, contribute deeply to the election of Donald Trump; but, as has been widely noted, his [tax policy](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/coming-to-terms-with-trumponomics), for example, seems highly likely to make the problem of inequality worse. What’s going on?\n\n\n\nTo begin with, we have to take into account the fact that, on the whole, we are all far better off now than we were a century ago, or even a few decades ago. People at the lowest levels of society today have life styles that are much better than those of the higher classes in generations past. As Louis C.K. [puts it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiVi1sR2rM), we’re a generation of “spoiled idiots”—“everything is amazing right now, and nobody’s happy” is his way of putting it. We take for granted things that would be considered miracles by our great-grandparents, or even by our parents—running water, flat-screen TVs, pre-food-poisoning Chipotle, smartphones. (Louis C.K. is especially impressed by those, reminiscing about the rotary phone he had as a child.)\n\n\n\nThat can’t explain everything, however, since psychologists have long known that relative social standing also makes a huge difference in reported happiness. It’s not just how much you have; it’s also how much you have relative to others. Even if you’re perfectly comfortable, you might start feeling like you’re not that well off if the Joneses—and the Smiths and the Doyles—have more. Back in the eighteenth century, Adam Smith quipped that women in England required better [shoes](https://books.google.com/books?id=OlpZAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA332&lpg=PA332&dq=%22without+any+discredit%22+adam+smith&source=bl&ots=qUR29334oV&sig=Va7hQGAa6qqi_W0T92thp1IfHGU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDiLWclavQAhVprFQKHRYgC4YQ6AEILjAD%20-%20v=onepage&q=%22without) than women in Scotland: relative standards were higher, and it would be shameful for women of a certain social standing in England to have inferior shoes. The absolute quality of the shoes didn’t change, but the relative quality did. “Relative is what matters,” Shai Davidai, a psychologist at the New School whose research is devoted to social inequality, told me recently.\n\n\n\nIt’s a phenomenon that [isn’t relegated](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268104000885) to social status. It permeates how we see just about everything in life. If your children go to a good school, but there are better schools nearby, are you placing them at a disadvantage? On an absolute level, their education might be just fine—even better than just fine. Relatively, it’s worse than what they could theoretically be getting, and what the kid next door might be getting. Our lives don’t make sense in abstraction, only when compared with the lives of others. Why, then, Davidai asked himself, can places like the United States have such stark inequality and still remain relatively socially stable?\n\n\n\nThe answer, it turns out, has two elements above and beyond the fact that we are all better off than before. First, Americans tend not to realize just how much inequality exists. “Across the population, people underestimate wealth inequality,” Davidai says. Ideally, people think that wealth inequality should be relatively low. “When we ask one question—how much _should_ we have?—we find that most people don’t actually want egalitarianism. But, in their ideal world, they underestimate the true extent of inequality and want much less than actually exists. They aren’t riled up, because they don’t understand the extent.” In a nationally representative survey, from 2011, the psychologists Michael Norton and Dan Ariely [found](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely.pdf) that people routinely underestimated existing wealth inequality. For instance, they believed that the top quintile held fifty-nine per cent of the wealth; in reality, it held eighty-four per cent. The U.S. has [some](https://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Global_Inequality.pdf) of the most significant [income inequality](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm) in the developed world, yet people seem routinely to underestimate that fact.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, it turns out that people are fine with large relative disadvantages, as long as they think that the borders between groups are reasonably fluid. That is the essence of the American Dream. As long as you think that you, personally, can make it someday, you don’t mind so much if you’re not making it right now. As the writer William Dean Howells put it back in 1894, “Inequality is as dear to the American heart as liberty itself.”\n\n\n\nTo test that notion directly, Davidai and Thomas Gilovich recently [asked](http://pps.sagepub.com/content/10/1/60.full) just over three thousand people from a nationally representative sample one big question: What is the likelihood that a “randomly selected” American born in either the richest or the poorest quintile of the population would move to one of the other quintiles as an adult? They found a consistent pattern: people overestimated the extent to which it was possible to move up social brackets, but vastly underestimated how likely it was to suffer downward mobility. If someone was born in the bottom quintile, the respondents thought that person had a forty-three-per-cent chance of moving to the middle quintile or farther up; in reality, the likelihood is closer to thirty per cent. Meanwhile, they thought that someone born at the top had only a thirty-three-per-cent chance of making a comparable drop, which is a bit less than the percentage of people who actually experience that fall. In our minds, the American Dream seems to work primarily in one direction—up. “The poor can become rich, but the rich don’t have to clear their spots to make room,” Davidai says.\n\n\n\nWhy is this the case? Why do we see upward mobility as relatively attainable but downward movement as far less likely? Here’s one possibility: there is a [basic human tendency](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=hEoG8OrIR7sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA85&dq=the+better-than-average+effect+alicke&ots=aycn9W8HwX&sig=gKVYOOSFf2E43DFWsSJalrZEBF8#v=onepage&q&f=false) to overestimate our relative standing regarding almost anything positive. We [think we are](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1774633) smarter, nicer, and generally better than average at all good things. And we overestimate our ability to reach goals we set for ourselves; we don’t account enough for the role of external circumstances and put too much value on our own internal drive and ability. In that sense, all over the world, dissatisfaction with inequality should be somewhat mitigated by our inherent optimism. In [a classic 1935 study](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1935-04108-001), participants predicted their future success based on how well they wanted to do—not how they had done in the past. The Harvard psychologist Jerome Frank asked people to play a game of quoits—you throw rings onto a stick, as in an amusement-park test of skill. It should be easy to figure out if your hand-eye coördination and general fairground dexterity are good. The rings will go onto the stick and not land somewhere else. But Frank found something curious. When people did poorly, they still predicted that they would do much better in the future—if, that is, they wanted to do well. And they made up excuses for their past failures that had nothing to do with innate ability. “If I were up against competition, I could do much better,” one person said. It’s not that I suck at throwing rings onto sticks; it’s that you set me up in the wrong environment.\n\n\n\nBut, Davidai argues, perhaps a more pertinent explanation, at least in the United States, is one that is distinctly rooted in Western culture: our obsession with the underdog. “You have Rocky fighting the champion, the Little Engine That Could. You have stories of successful businessmen rising from nothing—Martha Stewart, Steve Jobs. You root for underdog teams in sports,” he says. (When he says “you,” he means Americans; Davidai is from Israel, and does not see the same phenomenon there to the same extent.) From an early age, a sort of pro-underdog mentality permeates American culture, from our books to our films to our athletic traditions. Think of all the love that the Cubs got for just this reason.\n\n\n\nOur underdog-loving culture, Davidai posits, may account for much of the reason that we overestimate upward mobility. His lab is currently developing studies to test this hypothesis, by, for instance, having people take an underdog perspective and seeing if that influences beliefs in mobility: if you watch “Rocky,” say, will you be more likely to think that mobility is possible? But thus far Davidai has been stymied in his attempts to create the perfect experimental design, for one simple reason: lack of material. “It’s almost impossible to find sports stories not about underdogs, for example,” he says. When was the last children’s book you read about the popular, attractive kid who does well? Somehow, I don’t think George Lucas would be among the most successful filmmakers of all time if he crafted a tale of the popular, disciplined kid with the stable family and the perfect role model of a father who—miracle of all miracles—ended up following in the family tradition of becoming a talented warrior. So rooted is the rags-to-riches approach in our culture, so deeply does it permeate our storytelling, that it can be tough to find a balanced approach.\n\n\n\nBut Davidai is starting where he can—at home, with an experimental sample size of one. He is doing everything he can to make sure his child is _not_ exposed to the traditional underdog narratives. One book he won’t be reading to his infant: “The Little Engine That Could.” “I have always hated that book,” he told me. “Some engines can’t, and it’s not their fault.”","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/americas-surprising-views-on-income-inequality","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e21c33be92f2c7e52aadd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e21c33be92f2c7e52aadd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Income","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"income"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Income","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"income"},{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ada1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ada1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Inequality","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"inequality"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Inequality","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"inequality"},{"id":"5c2e1dc7b75f002c8941e5cf","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1dc7b75f002c8941e5cf","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Social Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"social-science"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Social Science","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"social-science"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"},{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

Trump’s proposed tax cuts don’t make sense, Summers said, because they would target very high earners, meaning that a lot of the money they free up could end up being saved, rather than spent. And Trump’s infrastructure plans are questionable, Summers argued, because in at least one version of the plans, they depend largely on private financing. The problem, Summers said, is that pension funds and other big investors won’t invest in essential tasks like repairing the nation’s roads, bridges, and airports, because projects like those don’t produce any revenues. So where would the financing for them come from?\n\n\n\n\n\nSummers’s points, like many of the other criticisms of Trumponomics, are well taken. We know for sure, for instance, that Trump’s proposed tax cuts would greatly accentuate inequality. (“To those who hath, it shall be given,” Martin Wolf, of the _Financial Times_, [quipped](https://www.ft.com/content/31b062e8-a842-11e6-8898-79a99e2a4de6) this week.) And if those tax cuts aren’t matched by spending cuts, they will run up the budget deficit and increase the country’s already large debt burden. But if the tax cuts instead prompt cutbacks in non-discretionary spending, particularly government investments in education and scientific research, they will undermine economic growth over the long term. Trump’s protectionist impulses, meanwhile, almost certainly won’t bring back lost manufacturing jobs, but they could spark a damaging trade war. And if Trump continues to attack the Federal Reserve, as he did during the campaign, he might well provoke a sell-off in the financial markets, maybe even a collapse in the value of the dollar.\n\n\n\nDespite all this, it’s worth recognizing that, in proposing tax cuts and infrastructure spending, Trump, like Ronald Reagan before him, is adopting a bastard form of Keynesianism. And, for the past few years, many Keynesian economists and observers, Summers included, have been arguing that the biggest factor holding back the American economy is a shortage of over-all demand, and that the best way to deal with this would be for the federal government to increase its outlays on things like infrastructure projects, taking advantage of low interest rates to issue more debt. Conservatives and Republicans, by contrast, have argued that it was essential, instead, to reduce the budget deficit and hold the line on spending. When President Obama proposed more infrastructure spending, his requests went nowhere. But he was a Democrat.\n\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the Republican Party now potentially embracing a kind of crypto-Keynesian program knows no bounds. But what if this feckless gambit works, at least for a while? What if Trump’s reckless policies, like Reagan’s reckless policies in the early nineteen-eighties, succeed in geeing up the economy, raising the growth rate of G.D.P., and boosting wages and incomes? It might just be a kind of national sugar high, but could it last long enough to help the Republicans retain control of Congress in 2018 and give Trump a platform on which to run for reëlection, in 2020?\n\n\n\nThis is the nightmare scenario for Democrats—but it’s just one scenario. There is a host of differences between today and November, 1980. For one thing, Reagan was elected following a recession, meaning that there was a lot of spare capacity in the economy. The unemployment rate also stood at 7.5 per cent. Today, we are in the eighth year of an economic expansion, and the jobless rate is 4.9 per cent. Standard economic theory suggests that if you try to stimulate an economy that is already operating at full employment, or something close to it, you will only succeed in driving up interest rates and inflation—the end result is likely to be a recession.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Moody’s Analytics argued that a comedown from a Trumponomics sugar high wouldn’t be delayed long—a year or two, perhaps—and then we’d face the prospect of a deep slump. “Under the scenario in which all his stated policies become law in the manner proposed, the economy suffers a lengthy recession and is smaller at the end of his four-year term than when he took office,” Moody’s said [in a report](https://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/2016-06-17-Trumps-Economic-Policies.pdf) issued in June. “By the end of his presidency, there are close to 3.5 million fewer jobs and the unemployment rate rises to as high as 7%, compared with below 5% today.” Moody’s also considered a second scenario, “Trump Lite,” in which his tax cuts were reduced from $9.5 trillion to $3.5 trillion over ten years. Even in this case, the analysis predicted a deep recession beginning in 2018. By 2020, the report said, the unemployment rate would be 8.9 per cent.\n\n\n\nWe can probably assume that Trump wouldn’t get reëlected in four years’ time if the unemployment rate is seven per cent or higher. It should be noted, however, that the gloomy Moody’s analysis depends on a number of assumptions, the most important of which is that the economy is indeed currently operating at full employment. Moody’s also took it as given that Trump would follow through on his pledge to deport millions of undocumented workers, thereby reducing the U.S. labor supply and forcing employers to offer higher wages to attract workers. That might sound like good news for workers, but it would probably prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more rapidly than it would have otherwise. And, finally, Moody’s assumed that Trump would go ahead and impose tariffs on goods from Mexico and China. In addition to starting a trade war, such a policy would raise the cost of imported goods, put more upward pressure on inflation, and provide the Fed with another reason to hurry up and raise rates.\n\n\n\nThese assumptions may turn out to be reasonable, or they might not. Some economists believe there is more slack in the labor market than the headline unemployment rate indicates. If so, Trump’s stimulus could prompt more discouraged workers and retired people to go out and look for jobs, which, at least for a time, would raise the labor-force participation rate, which might in turn check wage inflation. It is also at least conceivable that Trump will back off his mass-deportation plans. And lately his statements about imposing tariffs have sounded more like a threat, or a bargaining tool, than an actual policy commitment.\n\n\n\nAt this stage, there remains too much uncertainty about the scope, details, and likely consequences of Trump’s economic program to make reliable predictions. The infrastructure plan that Summers criticized, for one, is just [a proposal](http://www.peternavarro.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/infrastructurereport.pdf). If, as some reports indicate, Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic Minority Leader, is prepared to negotiate with Trump about the details of his infrastructure plan, things could end up looking very different. On top of that, it is still possible that Paul Ryan, the House Speaker, along with his fellow-Republican deficit hawks, will push to dramatically scale down both the infrastructure plans and the proposed tax cuts. The economists at Goldman Sachs say their best guess is that Trump will end up getting less than half of the infrastructure spending he wants, and less than a third of the individual tax cuts he has proposed.\n\n\n\nAnother unknown is how the Federal Reserve will react to Trump’s Administration. For the past couple of years, Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, has hesitated to raise interest rates, partly because she sympathizes with the view that there is still some hidden slack in the labor market. Now that Trump is headed for the White House, will Yellen and her colleagues move to raise rates more rapidly, or will they be willing to accommodate a fiscal stimulus?\n\n\n\nFinally, it’s far from clear how the financial markets, particularly the bond markets, will react over the long term to a Trump Presidency, and the prospect of larger deficits. In normal times, U.S. Treasury bonds are regarded as a safe haven, which helps keep interest rates, including mortgage rates, low. The times aren’t normal, though. If investors came to believe that the Trump Administration was embarking on a credit binge, or turning the United States into a banana republic, sentiment could change rapidly.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the good name and financial credibility of the United States government depends on faith in the country’s political system. Come January 20, 2017, that system will have at its helm a tax-dodging, self-promoting businessman and reality-television star who, among other things, stands accused of running a fraudulent enterprise—Trump University. Expect some turbulence ahead.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/coming-to-terms-with-trumponomics","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d5a22d4972cd5b83367","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Economics","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"economics"},{"id":"5c2e1cc341e4c73c088d77e4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Recession","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"recession"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f15a2179605b11ad1ec0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"John Cassidy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"john-cassidy"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

You’ve maybe even quoted them, especially now that it’s election season. “[Conservatives More Susceptible to Bullshit Than Liberals](https://reason.com/blog/2016/05/17/conservatives-more-susceptible-to-bullsh).” “[Study: Are Liberals Smarter Than Conservatives](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1968042,00.html#ixzz0gw6qkclr)?” “[Studies: Conservatives Are from Mars, Liberals Are from Venus](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/studies-conservatives-are-from-mars-liberals-are-from-venus/252416/).” All of these tantalizing connections between personalities and politics sound academic if not downright scientific—they cite studies, after all—and, depending on your own political leanings, you’ve likely had one of two reactions: _Of course, I knew it!_ or _This is bogus!_ As it turns out, if you’re in the second camp you’re probably right—but maybe for a reason that’s different from what you thought.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many political psychologists, it seems [abundantly](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=1701816) [clear](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3792381?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that [traits and politics](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7449472) go together. There’s evidence that many aspects of personality develop quite early in life and have a genetic component, but we don’t become actively political until we are older. So it’s sensible to assume that the one might have some bearing on the other. But most of the work on the subject in the past decades has consisted merely of scientists conducting surveys and observing correlations. Few researchers have ever asked whether what they’re seeing actually implies causality or if the correlations are even meaningful. (The fact that correlation does not equal causation has been amply illustrated by a self-styled correlation debunker, [Tyler Vigen](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations); a recent visit to his eponymous Web site shows a 0.998 regional correlation between U.S. spending on science and technology and suicides by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation.) And so, almost a decade ago, Brad Verhulst, a behavioral geneticist now at Virginia Commonwealth University, asked himself just that: Is the personality-politics link truly causal? A relationship between personality and political leanings is “a completely reasonable thing to expect,” he told me when we spoke recently. He wanted to use his knowledge as a geneticist to explore the causal linkage that he was certain would be there.\n\n\n\nHe found something quite different. “Unfortunately, the empirical evidence doesn’t seem to support that strong causal hypothesis,” he said. In an [analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809096/) of 28,877 people from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (known as the Virginia 30,000), and then in a second, separate [longitudinal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347987/) that followed a group of more than eight thousand twins and siblings for ten years, he found no evidence of any form of causation. Instead, he found a relationship that was more complicated. It is far more likely that politics and personality traits are both influenced by some earlier genetic and environmental factors. In other words, they may indeed be related, but the fact that someone is liberal does not make him more tolerant, for instance, just as being tolerant does not make someone liberal.\n\n\n\nIn the first sample (the Virginia 30,000) Verhulst and his collaborators found that, while some modest correlations did exist between certain traits and attitudes—for example, between conservative economic views and measures of neuroticism—there was no evidence that there was anything causal to the correlations. But genetic analyses can be tricky. So Verhulst and Peter Hatemi tried a longitudinal study: follow people over time, map their personality and political leanings, and see if changes in the one cause changes in the other. They looked at two samples, one of adults (7,610 twins and siblings who were between the ages of nineteen and seventy-eight in 1980) and one of adolescents (1,061 twins and siblings who were between sixteen and nineteen in 1998). Each group had been tested in two waves, ten years apart. At both points, researchers looked at political attitudes (views on topics such as abortion and gay marriage, as well as responses to statements such as “I believe we should look to our religious authorities for decisions on moral issues”) and personality measures. They found that personality did shift over time—not by huge amounts, but perceptibly. People could become more or less extroverted, more agreeable or conscientious, or any number of things. Political attitudes were slightly more stable, among both the adolescents and the adults: people who were conservative tended to stay conservative. And, most important, changes in personality did not predict changes in politics. “We conclude that both personality traits and political attitudes are independently part of one’s psychological architecture,” the authors write.\n\n\n\nNone of this work denies the possible existence of correlations between some traits and some beliefs, but it does raise the question of what those correlations signify—especially since, setting aside the issue of causality, some early research on politics and personality may have overstated the connections because of a built-in tautology. As it turns out, in many of the early conceptions of personality traits political leanings were purposefully built into the survey questions used to assess personality. Early theorists explicitly wanted to capture political attitudes with their scales. For instance, in order to measure “openness,” Robert McCrae and Paul Costa, the creators of one of the most widely used [personality measures](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/019188699290236I), the NEO-PI-R, use “favors conservative values” as one of the items to assess the degree to which someone possesses a trait. In measures of agreeableness, there are items like “we can never do too much for the poor and elderly” and “human need should always take priority over economic considerations”—both statements that are embedded in a specific political ideology. In other words, our political beliefs are actually used to assess our level of the trait. By definition, we are higher on openness, say, if we are politically liberal.\n\n\n\nThat circularity, however, is often lost on modern minds. So what happens when we look for correlations between, say, openness and liberalism? We find one because it’s largely tautological. It doesn’t help that most of the scales are proprietary and, hence, not publicly available: it’s hard to find a list of items that contribute to each facet and, therefore, to see for yourself just how embedded politics already are in traits that people mainly think of as abstract concepts.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Verhulst if it was possible to circumvent this, he pointed out two things: first, not all traits are tautological (openness is the most egregious example). If you wanted to study risk-taking, for instance, you could conceivably avoid any sort of circularity. And, second, some people try to remove the political items—but with mixed results. “If you are concerned with political attitudes, you might remove items that are explicitly political,” he told me. “But just because you’ve taken those out doesn’t mean you’ve fundamentally changed what openness measures. Even if you’re removing some of the completely tautological items, you aren’t quite hitting that problem.” So in his studies Verhulst also used an entirely different scale, one that is “relatively untainted by explicitly political items,” as he and his co-authors write. The non-causal correlations he does find are in the weak 0.2–0.4 range. (A perfect correlation is 1; 0.2 is [considered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576830/) “negligible,” while 0.4 is “low.”)\n\n\n\nBut the desire for causality, or at least some basic truths—_Of course those Republicans are closed-minded people! Of course those damn Democrats are neurotic!_—persists. And despite studies like Verhulst’s, we can’t seem to let it go. Headlines keep appearing; researchers keep pointing it out. Verhulst’s 2012 paper—the analysis of the Virginia 30,000—was recently in the news because of an authorial [correction](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12216/full). It seems that one of the minor correlational directions had been reversed: it was liberals, not conservatives, who scored slightly higher on a measure of psychoticism, which takes into account aggressiveness, antisocial tendencies, and egocentricity, among other traits. (“[Science Says Liberals, Not Conservatives, Are Psychotic](http://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/),” the New York _Post_ wrote.) In the correction note, Verhulst, Hatemi, and a co-author, Lindon Eaves, stressed that the error, while regrettable and sloppy, didn’t actually affect any of the paper’s main conclusions: that there was no causality between personality and politics, and that correlations were small. Really, neither liberals nor conservatives are particularly likely to display traits of psychoticism, and, to the extent that liberals are, it’s no more related to their politics than to their shirt size. “We found no evidence that personality traits play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes,” the authors [write](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691630407X). “Our focus and novel results showed that whatever the directions of the correlations are between personality traits and attitudes, the relationships are spurious.” And so, while it of course needed to be fixed, at the end of the day it didn’t matter all that much.\n\n\n\nOthers in the [media](https://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/) and in politics thought otherwise. At least in the U.S., the party you believe in plays a big role in how you conceive of yourself. It feels good to think that your party is smarter, and that the smarts are what drive people to your party. It also feels good to say that the other guys are psychos. “ ‘It’s spurious, there’s no causal relationship,’ ” Verhulst says. “That could be pretty depressing for people who’ve invested a lot of time in this.” Here’s what won’t make a good headline: “Small and Spurious Correlation Shown to Have Been Backward, but It Doesn’t Matter That Much, Because the Point of the Paper Was That There Is No Underlying Causation After All.”\n\n\n\nSocial psychology touches on our most cherished beliefs about how the world _should_ operate. We are more than happy to accept the counterintuitive—as long as it doesn’t conflict with our central notions of what ought to be. And, when it comes to politics, it can be awfully difficult to put your desires aside and to acknowledge that the world is a much messier place, where open-minded people might be conservative and liberals may well be conscientious. “People get passionate when they’re talking about these things,” Verhulst points out. “It would be nice if it was less passionate, but political values really do have a profound impact on our daily lives, as do the personality traits we have. They are fundamentally striking at what it means to be human.” And so levelheadedness remains difficult. Here’s a headline you’re not so likely to see: “Conservatives Are from Earth, Liberals Are from Earth, and Scientists Aren’t Really Sure About How They End Up That Way.”","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/politics-and-personality-most-of-what-you-read-is-malarkey","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

By the time he reached college, though, he’d moved on to a new obsession: becoming a golf pro. “I was very serious about it,” he told me. “I practiced religiously. It was very deliberate practice.” Every day, for hours, he’d be out swinging and putting. He expected to find himself on his way to glory. Except it didn’t quite~­~ work out that way. Instead, young Zach was confronted with an uncomfortable truth: “I just wasn’t very good.” He saw other students, even kids around town—many of them, far less devoted and far less driven—and many of them played a better game. When he tried out for the college team, he didn’t even come close to making it. “I thought, What is the deal here?”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was Hambrick’s introduction to an age-old debate: nature versus nurture, genetics versus effort. We’ve been having it long before we knew what DNA was. Right around the same time Gregor Mendel was messing about with his famous peas, Charles Darwin’s cousin, Francis Galton, was positing that genius tends to run in families. Take almost any enterprise and find its most famous voices, he argued, and you’re led to family trees of great accomplishment, much like his own. (He would take this notion to an extreme with his eugenics program.) And, while that view hasn’t survived in its extreme form, the basic question still guides modern research—not nature versus nurture so much as just how _much_ nature, and just how _much_ nurture?\n\n\n\nAfter finishing college, Hambrick began graduate work in psychology at Georgia Tech, with Timothy Salthouse, looking at aging and expertise in older adults. Despite his failures at golf, Hambrick was still very much of the belief that, given enough effort, you could reach excellence. Maybe golf just hadn’t been the right thing for him. In 1996, when the Olympics came to Atlanta, the students had to leave campus to make way for the athletes and visitors, and Salthouse suggested that Hambrick spend a few months at Florida State University. There, he ended up working with Anders Ericsson, a professor of psychology. A couple of years earlier, Ericsson and Neil Charness had [published](http://web.mit.edu/6.969/www/readings/expertise.pdf) a provocative paper arguing that training and so-called deliberate practice could describe performance differences that had been previously ascribed to innate talent. “The traditional view of talent, which concludes that successful individuals have special innate abilities and basic capacities, is not consistent with the reviewed evidence,” Ericsson and Charness wrote. “Differences between expert and less accomplished performers reflect acquired knowledge and skills or physiological adaptations effected by training, with the only confirmed exception being height.” In other words, training was everything. Hambrick _could_ have become a world-class golfer with enough practice. Maybe he’d given up too soon.\n\n\n\nIt’s a provocative argument, and one that Ericsson still espouses over two decades later, having made a single modification to his list of exceptions: body size joined height as one of only two areas with any possible genetic influence. When we spoke recently, I presented him with multiple papers from different labs, from studies on the heredity of talent in twins to genetics papers on specific gene variants implicated in performance. But he held firm to his argument. He told me he had yet to encounter someone presenting him with evidence that anything other than practice matters. (He did, in a later conversation, add that the age at which one begins practicing can make a difference in someone’s achievement level.) “I have no problem conceptually with this idea of genetic differences,” he said when we first spoke, “but nothing I’ve seen has convinced me this is actually the case. There’s compelling evidence that if it’s length of bones, that cannot be explained by training. We know you can’t influence diameter of bones. But that’s really it.”\n\n\n\nIf that’s true, it means that the sky is the limit, especially if you’re dealing with areas other than athletics, where length of bones can offer no competitive edge. Follow your dreams and, with enough training—an average of ten thousand hours, as [the famous formulation](http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule) goes—you can reach them, whether they involve golf or poetry. (It’s important to note here that Malcolm Gladwell, who popularized Ericsson’s work in his book “Outliers,” takes a much more nuanced position and has [argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2740ct/hi_im_malcolm_gladwell_author_of_the_tipping/chx6dpv) that practice isn’t sufficient. “I could play chess for 100 years and I’ll never be a grandmaster,” he has written. “The point is simply that natural ability requires a huge investment of time in order to be made manifest.”)\n\n\n\nBut Hambrick obviously didn’t become a golf pro. And, if you look closely at ten thousand hours as an average, rather than absolute, number, you can start to see a problem with it. If, as shown even in Ericsson’s own data, some people require fewer hours and some require more to reach an identical point, doesn’t that imply that some individual difference _other_ than practice is at play? When I brought this issue up with Hambrick, he noted that, in his introductory psychology course, some of the students who study very little do better than the ones who study a lot.\n\n\n\nSo I asked Ericsson if, given all the advances in genetics research and all the work on the science of expertise and élite performance that has taken place since his original formulation, he still believed in the preëminent importance of training. Do natural, heritable abilities really mean nothing? If, for instance, he himself could choose my trainer and design the perfect training plan, could I become a world-class pianist? (I chose this example since I played for many years in my youth and easily have ten thousand hours in hand.) At first, Ericsson demurred, refusing a straight yes-or-no answer in favor of asking questions about my past. Why hadn’t I been better as a child? Perhaps I wasn’t motivated? No, I assured him, I was. Perhaps my teacher wasn’t qualified? No, I responded. She was a former professor at a music conservatory in Russia. Maybe, I countered, I’m just not particularly talented at piano. He refused to accept that, and ultimately blamed my teacher. Clearly, she didn’t provide the _right_ deliberate practice. I’d be in a different profession today if only she’d been better.\n\n\n\nHambrick blames something else. That summer in Florida, in 1996, he and Ericsson grew close. He remembers meeting often at Ericsson’s F.S.U. office, going to his house to peruse his book collection, taking in F.S.U. basketball games on later visits. “It was fantastic. Wonderful, inspiring conversations,” he recalls. Together with one of Ericsson’s own students, Len Hill, they decided to tackle the golf question head-on. Hambrick spent weeks tracking down data for P.G.A. tour stats and running analyses to determine how the pros reached their level of success. The work continued when he returned to Atlanta, and even went on into the first years of his professorship at Michigan State University. But the analyses weren’t turning out quite as expected—training was not explaining nearly as much as it should. So, while the work languished in unpublished state, Hambrick began to focus more and more on the other possible components of expert accomplishment. Of course, training was important—but how important? “I started to ask, Well, wait a second, can these strong claims about the primacy of practice actually hold up—is there the evidence to back it up?” The more he researched, the more he concluded that the answer was no. No matter how much he had practiced as a teen-ager, he would never have reached the P.G.A. tour. Of course, he’d known that all along, on some level—after all, he quit golf. People do have natural ceilings to their talent in any given area, and after a certain point their success arose from things other than deliberate practice.\n\n\n\nIn [one study](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/21/7/914), for instance, Hambrick looked at pianists and measured their working memory, or the ability to keep chunks of information in mind and accessible for short periods of time. In the past, working-memory capacity [has been found](http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v4/n9/full/tp201481a.html) to be [heritable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163233/). In his sample, it predicted success even when you accounted for the effects of practice; pianists with better working memory were better at sight reading—and increased practice did not alter the effect. When [he looked back](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616301593) to one of the most frequently studied groups in expertise research, chess players, he found that, in addition to working or short-term memory, three more components of cognitive ability—fluid reasoning, comprehension knowledge, and processing speed, all abilities that are, to some extent, heritable—were related to performance. This was especially true of younger and less experienced players. If you’re naturally better, you don’t have to practice quite as much to get good.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nSo how much did practice actually explain? In a [2014 meta-analysis](http://www.scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Macnamara-et-al.-2014.pdf) that looked specifically at the relationship between deliberate practice and performance in music, games like chess, sports, education, and other professions, Hambrick and his team found a relationship that was even more complex than they had expected. For some things, like games, practice explained about a quarter of variance in expertise. For music and sports, the explanatory power accounted for about a fifth. But for education and professions like computer science, military-aircraft piloting, and sales, the effect ranged from small to tiny. For all of these professions, you obviously need to practice, but natural abilities matter more.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s more, the explanatory power of practice fell even further when Hambrick took exact level of expertise into account. In sports—one of the areas in which deliberate practice seems to make the most difference—it [turned out](http://www.drjimtaylor.com/4.0/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Deliberate-Practice-and-Elite-Sports-Performance.pdf) that the more advanced the athlete, the less of a role practice plays. Training an average athlete for a set number of hours yields far more results than training an élite athlete, which, in turn, yields greater results than training a super-élite athlete. Put differently, someone like me is going to improve a great deal with even a few hundred hours of training. But within an Olympic team tiny differences in performance are unlikely to be the result of training: these athletes train together, with the same coach, day in and day out. Those milliseconds come from somewhere else. Some may be due to the fact that genetic differences can account for some of the response to training. At Stanford’s *ELITE*{: .small} study, which looks at the most accomplished athletes in the world, Euan Ashley, a professor of medicine and genetics, is studying how an Olympian’s body may respond differently to a given training [regimen](http://ashleylab.stanford.edu/athletes.html). Some changes are due to genetic variants that may affect blood transport or oxygen uptake or fat metabolism, or any other number of factors. Some are due to sheer luck—How much sleep did you get? How are you feeling? And some, of course, are due to hours of training. But at the top of the top of the top, the power of additional training falls off sharply.\n\n\n\nSo where else, exactly, do performance differences come from? While Hambrick’s work has been focussed more explicitly on practice and genetics, David Lubinski, a professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University, has been approaching the question from a slightly different angle: through what’s called the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (*SMPY*{: .small}), a longitudinal study of the lives of students who, by the age of thirteen, had scored in the top one per cent of mathematical-reasoning ability and were then selected to take part in an enriched educational environment. (The study, co-directed for many years by Lubinski and his wife, Vanderbilt’s education-school dean, Camilla Benbow, was described in detail in a [recent article](http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-raise-a-genius-lessons-from-a-45-year-study-of-super-smart-children-1.20537) in _Nature._) It’s a crucial supplement to work like Hambrick’s; the data you get from close observation of the same sample and the same individuals over time can answer questions other approaches can’t. “What kinds of practice are more effective? What approaches more effective for some people than others?” Hambrick asks. “We need all the pieces to the puzzle to maximize people’s potential. Lubinski’s work on mathematically precocious youth is an essential piece.”\n\n\n\nNow, more than [four decades](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/12/2217) since the *SMPY*{: .small} observation began, we are beginning to see some answers. Perhaps not surprisingly, kids in both the *SMPY*{: .small} sample and an [unrelated cohort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27225220) of talented students identified by Duke University excel at measures like academic accomplishment, patents, publications, academic tenure, and organizational leadership. They reach full professorship and C.E.O. status at rates far above any population norm. They were selected on nothing more than measurable intellectual promise, and here they are.\n\n\n\nThat is not the whole story, though, as Lubinski points out. To him, the interesting finding is the striking range of abilities within this élite sample. “Individual differences in the top one per cent matter,” Lubinski told me. “People think of the top one per cent, whether in I.Q. or reasoning or what have you, as categorical. But that top contains one-third of the ability range you see in other samples. There is a huge amount of psychological diversity among the gifted.” Some accomplish a lot, but some, even with all their promise, end up indistinguishable from their initially less gifted counterparts. Genes give everyone a possible peak, but whether you reach that peak depends on a constellation of other factors.\n\n\n\nPart of the difference in accomplishment, it turns out, really is due to practice, just like Ericsson argues. “What separates intellectually talented kids from their intellectual peers when it comes to actual creative advances? A lot of it is how much people are willing to work,” Lubinski told me. Some people are gifted, or “intellectually talented,” as he prefers to refer to them, but don’t want to work forty hours a week, while some want to work more than sixty hours. “That has huge implications. Chance always favors the prepared mind.” Practice, work ethic: differences that aren’t apparent at age thirteen will, in their presence or absence, become magnified by the time you hit your forties or fifties. (As it turns out, though, even work ethic may be heritable. Hambrick has recently published a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957535) on the heritability of practice, using eight hundred pairs of twins. “Practice is actually heritable. There have now been two reports of this—ours, and [one using ten thousand twins](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/9/1795). And practice is substantially heritable.”)\n\n\n\nAlso crucially important is one of the first things that critics of studies like this point out: environment. These kids aren’t just identified young; they are then nurtured in a way others are not. How much of their success lies in opportunity? It’s a question Lubinski and Benbow have studied in some detail. In [three](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/15/4/217.abstract) [educational](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2010-19348-001)-[intervention](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2012-21982-001) studies, they have demonstrated that, if you compare intellectually talented children who have had the sorts of developmental opportunities the *SMPY*{: .small} affords, they end up doing better in terms of measurable intellectual achievements like number of patents and publications than their intellectual peers—individuals matched on general intellectual ability—who have not had that enriched experience.\n\n\n\nOpportunity must be there. Genes are great, but they need to have the right environment in which to flourish. You don’t just give birth to a “genius,” whether an academic or an athletic or an artistic one. You also give her the right environment, train her, encourage her, support her, challenge her, respond to her individuality. And who knows what else may ultimately matter. “All the abilities we assess, we still miss things,” Lubinski points out. Lewis Terman, the intellectual forefather of giftedness studies, famously missed two Nobel laureates in his selection. They were cut from the initial samples for not being gifted enough and never had a chance to take part in his study. “You’re tapping potential, but there’s also passion, commitment to work, people who want to do any one thing. People really vary. The diversity of human individuality is breathtaking.”\n\n\n\nThat diversity originates in our genetic code. But it becomes infinitely more complex as you add life into the mix. We cannot predict with accuracy who will become élite in a given field, but we know that genes and environment matter and that we all have different natural peaks that we can reach through application and training. Saying that training is everything may be tempting, but it’s wrong. “One of the criticisms people direct at us is that we’re killing people’s dreams,” Hambrick says. “But I think in fact it’s the contrary: the more we can know about the origins of expertise, including training but everything else, the more we can help people be their best selves.” Perhaps it’s just enough to know that no matter how many hours I spend in the pool, I won’t be Katie Ledecky.

We tell stories, create magnificent art and astounding technology, build cities, and explore space. We haven’t been around nearly as long as many other species, but in many respects we’ve accomplished more than any have before us. We eat them and they don’t eat us. We even run scientific studies on them—and are thinking about re-creating some of those that have gone extinct. But our intelligence comes with a curious caveat: our babies are among the dumbest—or, rather, the most helpless—that exist. A baby giraffe can stand within an hour of birth, and can even potentially flee predators on its first day of life. A monkey can grasp its mother and hang on for protection and nourishment. A human infant can’t even hold up its own head.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evolution of human intelligence isn’t something that Celeste Kidd had ever pondered. A developmental cognitive scientist who currently works at the University of Rochester, her work had focussed mostly on learning and decision-making in children. Over years of observing young children, she became impressed with the average child’s level of sophistication. But when she looked at the infants she encountered, she saw a baffling degree of helplessness: How could they be so incompetent one second and so bright so soon thereafter? One day, she posed the question to her colleague Steven Piantadosi. “Both of us wondered what could possibly justify the degree of helplessness human infants exhibit,” she told me recently. “Even other primate babies, like baby chimps, which are close in evolutionary terms, can cling onto their moms.” She began to see a contradiction: humans are born quite helpless, far more so than any other primate, but, fairly early on, we start becoming quite smart, again far more so than any other primate. What if this weren’t a contradiction so much as a causal pathway?\n\n\n\nThat’s the argument that Kidd and Piantadosi make in their [new paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/25/6874.abstract), published in a June issue of _PNAS._ Humans become so intelligent _because_ human infants are so incredibly helpless, they argue; the one necessitates the other. The theory is startling, but it isn’t entirely new. Researchers have been pondering the peculiarities of our birth and its evolutionary significance for quite some time. Humans belong to the subset of mammals, called viviparous mammals, that give live birth to their young. This means that infants must grow to a mature enough state inside the body to be born, but they can’t be so big that they are unable to come out. This leads to a trade-off: the more intelligent an animal is, the larger its head generally is, but the birth canal imposes an upper limit on just how large that head can be before it gets stuck. The brain, therefore, must keep maturing, and the head must continue growing, long after birth. The more intelligent an animal will eventually be, the more relatively immature its brain is at birth.\n\n\n\nResearchers have long known about this trade-off, and about the [connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18380864) between brain size and [neural density](http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(05)00082-3?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661305000823%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) and intelligence. For instance, Robin Dunbar [found](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships) that the ratio of neocortical volume to brain size can predict the social-group size in a number of species, including bats, cetaceans, and primates, while [Simon Reader](http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/reader/) [has](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/7/4436.abstract) [demonstrated](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/7/4141.full) links in tool use and innovation to brain size in primates. Kidd and Piantadosi’s new idea is that increased helplessness in newborns mandates increased intelligence in parents—and that a runaway selection dynamic can account for both. Natural selection favors humans with large brains, because those humans tend to be smarter. This may create evolutionary incentives for babies that are born at an even earlier developmental stage, which require more intelligence to raise. This creates the dynamic: over time, helpless babies make parents more intelligent, which makes babies more helpless, which makes their parents more intelligent, and so on.\n\n\n\nDuring their investigation, Kidd and Piantadosi realized something important that strengthened their theory. It turns out that another variable has an even higher correlation with intelligence than brain size—time to maturity, or weaning time. In other words, the time it takes to shepherd newborns through absolute helplessness to a point of relative self-sufficiency predicts primate intelligence more strongly than the best measure that has previously been proposed, namely, head circumference. Orangutans have smarter babies than baboons and they wean them longer. Baboon babies, in turn, are weaned longer, and are smarter, than lemur babies.\n\n\n\nPutting these facts together helped Kidd and Piantadosi develop their hypothesis. The connection between head size and intelligence does create incentives for babies to arrive earlier. But it’s the connection between weaning time and intelligence that may really be driving the cycle. You need to be smarter to care for more helpless creatures, which means you need a larger brain—which means that babies have to enter the world at an even more helpless stage of development, since there is a finite size to their brain at birth, mandated by the physiology of live birth. And so the cycle continues.\n\n\n\nOf course, the theory is just that—a model. Ideally, to prove it you would look at head size, birth time, and intelligence over the span of human evolution, to see if we were born earlier as we got smarter—data that are unavailable. (Kidd also stresses repeatedly that this theory supplements, but does not supplant, earlier ones: it can coexist quite naturally with both the social-group account of intelligence—the Dunbar approach—and what’s called the metabolic accounts of intelligence, which posits that our [digestive](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1520-6505(2000)9:4%3C156::AID-EVAN5%3E3.0.CO;2-7/abstract) system has [allowed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2744104?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) for our brain’s high metabolic needs, and that we grew smarter to be able to find and share difficult-to-gather food.) But there are some intriguing converging pieces of evidence. For one, other animals that are _not_ viviparous have not evolved the same levels of intelligence, suggesting an inherent link between live birth and brainpower. And in modern humans, a few pieces of evidence appear to suggest that smarter parents are more likely to have offspring that survive. In [one limited sample](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690800041X)—two hundred and twenty-two Serbian Roma women—maternal I.Q. and child mortality were negatively correlated (that is, higher I.Q. meant lower mortality), even controlling for education, age, and a number of other factors. In a [larger sample](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2061300?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) of Californian parents, in 1978, years of education were linked to infant-mortality rates. Global epidemiological studies [suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3070762) a decrease in mortality that equals between seven and nine per cent for each year of a mother’s education. None of this is decisive, of course, but it is suggestive.\n\n\n\nThere is, of course, one follow-up question: Why did this cycle happen to humans and not to lemurs? When I asked Kidd about this, she told me that their theory cannot offer an answer—likely as not, it’s a matter of pure genetic luck that became self-reinforcing. As we grew smarter, we were better able to take care of our infants, so they could be born more helpless and allow us to grow even smarter.\n\n\n\nOne intriguing way to test the hypothesis further: look at twins. Typically, twins are not carried to full term. Does that mean that twins are more intelligent than non-twins, since they require longer weaning time—and would a mother who is a twin, in turn, give birth to smarter children? “It’s a really good question, to look at the types of twins that run in families and whether that leads to higher intelligence,” Kidd said. “It’s a predictable hypothesis,” and one that they may well include in their ongoing research on train heritability in twins. And it’s a hypothesis that came, of all places, from a five-year-old—Kidd was being interviewed about twins for a \n\n+++podcast\n\n[#iframe: http://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=](100%x120)\n\n+++\n\n\n\n----------\n\n(http://www.scienceknocks.com/) by the daughter of Sindya Bhanoo, a former columnist at the _Times_.

There’s evidence that many aspects of personality develop quite early in life and have a genetic component, but we don’t become actively political until we are older. So it’s sensible to assume that the one might have some bearing on the other. But most of the work on the subject in the past decades has consisted merely of scientists conducting surveys and observing correlations. Few researchers have ever asked whether what they’re seeing actually implies causality or if the correlations are even meaningful. (The fact that correlation does not equal causation has been amply illustrated by a self-styled correlation debunker, [Tyler Vigen](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations); a recent visit to his eponymous Web site shows a 0.998 regional correlation between U.S. spending on science and technology and suicides by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation.) And so, almost a decade ago, Brad Verhulst, a behavioral geneticist now at Virginia Commonwealth University, asked himself just that: Is the personality-politics link truly causal? A relationship between personality and political leanings is “a completely reasonable thing to expect,” he told me when we spoke recently. He wanted to use his knowledge as a geneticist to explore the causal linkage that he was certain would be there.\n\n\n\nHe found something quite different. “Unfortunately, the empirical evidence doesn’t seem to support that strong causal hypothesis,” he said. In an [analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809096/) of 28,877 people from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (known as the Virginia 30,000), and then in a second, separate [longitudinal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347987/) that followed a group of more than eight thousand twins and siblings for ten years, he found no evidence of any form of causation. Instead, he found a relationship that was more complicated. It is far more likely that politics and personality traits are both influenced by some earlier genetic and environmental factors. In other words, they may indeed be related, but the fact that someone is liberal does not make him more tolerant, for instance, just as being tolerant does not make someone liberal.\n\n\n\nIn the first sample (the Virginia 30,000) Verhulst and his collaborators found that, while some modest correlations did exist between certain traits and attitudes—for example, between conservative economic views and measures of neuroticism—there was no evidence that there was anything causal to the correlations. But genetic analyses can be tricky. So Verhulst and Peter Hatemi tried a longitudinal study: follow people over time, map their personality and political leanings, and see if changes in the one cause changes in the other. They looked at two samples, one of adults (7,610 twins and siblings who were between the ages of nineteen and seventy-eight in 1980) and one of adolescents (1,061 twins and siblings who were between sixteen and nineteen in 1998). Each group had been tested in two waves, ten years apart. At both points, researchers looked at political attitudes (views on topics such as abortion and gay marriage, as well as responses to statements such as “I believe we should look to our religious authorities for decisions on moral issues”) and personality measures. They found that personality did shift over time—not by huge amounts, but perceptibly. People could become more or less extroverted, more agreeable or conscientious, or any number of things. Political attitudes were slightly more stable, among both the adolescents and the adults: people who were conservative tended to stay conservative. And, most important, changes in personality did not predict changes in politics. “We conclude that both personality traits and political attitudes are independently part of one’s psychological architecture,” the authors write.\n\n\n\nNone of this work denies the possible existence of correlations between some traits and some beliefs, but it does raise the question of what those correlations signify—especially since, setting aside the issue of causality, some early research on politics and personality may have overstated the connections because of a built-in tautology. As it turns out, in many of the early conceptions of personality traits political leanings were purposefully built into the survey questions used to assess personality. Early theorists explicitly wanted to capture political attitudes with their scales. For instance, in order to measure “openness,” Robert McCrae and Paul Costa, the creators of one of the most widely used [personality measures](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/019188699290236I), the NEO-PI-R, use “favors conservative values” as one of the items to assess the degree to which someone possesses a trait. In measures of agreeableness, there are items like “we can never do too much for the poor and elderly” and “human need should always take priority over economic considerations”—both statements that are embedded in a specific political ideology. In other words, our political beliefs are actually used to assess our level of the trait. By definition, we are higher on openness, say, if we are politically liberal.\n\n\n\nThat circularity, however, is often lost on modern minds. So what happens when we look for correlations between, say, openness and liberalism? We find one because it’s largely tautological. It doesn’t help that most of the scales are proprietary and, hence, not publicly available: it’s hard to find a list of items that contribute to each facet and, therefore, to see for yourself just how embedded politics already are in traits that people mainly think of as abstract concepts.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Verhulst if it was possible to circumvent this, he pointed out two things: first, not all traits are tautological (openness is the most egregious example). If you wanted to study risk-taking, for instance, you could conceivably avoid any sort of circularity. And, second, some people try to remove the political items—but with mixed results. “If you are concerned with political attitudes, you might remove items that are explicitly political,” he told me. “But just because you’ve taken those out doesn’t mean you’ve fundamentally changed what openness measures. Even if you’re removing some of the completely tautological items, you aren’t quite hitting that problem.” So in his studies Verhulst also used an entirely different scale, one that is “relatively untainted by explicitly political items,” as he and his co-authors write. The non-causal correlations he does find are in the weak 0.2–0.4 range. (A perfect correlation is 1; 0.2 is [considered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576830/) “negligible,” while 0.4 is “low.”)\n\n\n\nBut the desire for causality, or at least some basic truths—_Of course those Republicans are closed-minded people! Of course those damn Democrats are neurotic!_—persists. And despite studies like Verhulst’s, we can’t seem to let it go. Headlines keep appearing; researchers keep pointing it out. Verhulst’s 2012 paper—the analysis of the Virginia 30,000—was recently in the news because of an authorial [correction](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12216/full). It seems that one of the minor correlational directions had been reversed: it was liberals, not conservatives, who scored slightly higher on a measure of psychoticism, which takes into account aggressiveness, antisocial tendencies, and egocentricity, among other traits. (“[Science Says Liberals, Not Conservatives, Are Psychotic](http://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/),” the New York _Post_ wrote.) In the correction note, Verhulst, Hatemi, and a co-author, Lindon Eaves, stressed that the error, while regrettable and sloppy, didn’t actually affect any of the paper’s main conclusions: that there was no causality between personality and politics, and that correlations were small. Really, neither liberals nor conservatives are particularly likely to display traits of psychoticism, and, to the extent that liberals are, it’s no more related to their politics than to their shirt size. “We found no evidence that personality traits play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes,” the authors [write](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691630407X). “Our focus and novel results showed that whatever the directions of the correlations are between personality traits and attitudes, the relationships are spurious.” And so, while it of course needed to be fixed, at the end of the day it didn’t matter all that much.\n\n\n\nOthers in the [media](https://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/) and in politics thought otherwise. At least in the U.S., the party you believe in plays a big role in how you conceive of yourself. It feels good to think that your party is smarter, and that the smarts are what drive people to your party. It also feels good to say that the other guys are psychos. “ ‘It’s spurious, there’s no causal relationship,’ ” Verhulst says. “That could be pretty depressing for people who’ve invested a lot of time in this.” Here’s what won’t make a good headline: “Small and Spurious Correlation Shown to Have Been Backward, but It Doesn’t Matter That Much, Because the Point of the Paper Was That There Is No Underlying Causation After All.”\n\n\n\nSocial psychology touches on our most cherished beliefs about how the world _should_ operate. We are more than happy to accept the counterintuitive—as long as it doesn’t conflict with our central notions of what ought to be. And, when it comes to politics, it can be awfully difficult to put your desires aside and to acknowledge that the world is a much messier place, where open-minded people might be conservative and liberals may well be conscientious. “People get passionate when they’re talking about these things,” Verhulst points out. “It would be nice if it was less passionate, but political values really do have a profound impact on our daily lives, as do the personality traits we have. They are fundamentally striking at what it means to be human.” And so levelheadedness remains difficult. Here’s a headline you’re not so likely to see: “Conservatives Are from Earth, Liberals Are from Earth, and Scientists Aren’t Really Sure About How They End Up That Way.”","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/politics-and-personality-most-of-what-you-read-is-malarkey","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

We tell stories, create magnificent art and astounding technology, build cities, and explore space. We haven’t been around nearly as long as many other species, but in many respects we’ve accomplished more than any have before us. We eat them and they don’t eat us. We even run scientific studies on them—and are thinking about re-creating some of those that have gone extinct. But our intelligence comes with a curious caveat: our babies are among the dumbest—or, rather, the most helpless—that exist. A baby giraffe can stand within an hour of birth, and can even potentially flee predators on its first day of life. A monkey can grasp its mother and hang on for protection and nourishment. A human infant can’t even hold up its own head.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evolution of human intelligence isn’t something that Celeste Kidd had ever pondered. A developmental cognitive scientist who currently works at the University of Rochester, her work had focussed mostly on learning and decision-making in children. Over years of observing young children, she became impressed with the average child’s level of sophistication. But when she looked at the infants she encountered, she saw a baffling degree of helplessness: How could they be so incompetent one second and so bright so soon thereafter? One day, she posed the question to her colleague Steven Piantadosi. “Both of us wondered what could possibly justify the degree of helplessness human infants exhibit,” she told me recently. “Even other primate babies, like baby chimps, which are close in evolutionary terms, can cling onto their moms.” She began to see a contradiction: humans are born quite helpless, far more so than any other primate, but, fairly early on, we start becoming quite smart, again far more so than any other primate. What if this weren’t a contradiction so much as a causal pathway?\n\n\n\nThat’s the argument that Kidd and Piantadosi make in their [new paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/25/6874.abstract), published in a June issue of _PNAS._ Humans become so intelligent _because_ human infants are so incredibly helpless, they argue; the one necessitates the other. The theory is startling, but it isn’t entirely new. Researchers have been pondering the peculiarities of our birth and its evolutionary significance for quite some time. Humans belong to the subset of mammals, called viviparous mammals, that give live birth to their young. This means that infants must grow to a mature enough state inside the body to be born, but they can’t be so big that they are unable to come out. This leads to a trade-off: the more intelligent an animal is, the larger its head generally is, but the birth canal imposes an upper limit on just how large that head can be before it gets stuck. The brain, therefore, must keep maturing, and the head must continue growing, long after birth. The more intelligent an animal will eventually be, the more relatively immature its brain is at birth.\n\n\n\nResearchers have long known about this trade-off, and about the [connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18380864) between brain size and [neural density](http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(05)00082-3?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661305000823%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) and intelligence. For instance, Robin Dunbar [found](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships) that the ratio of neocortical volume to brain size can predict the social-group size in a number of species, including bats, cetaceans, and primates, while [Simon Reader](http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/reader/) [has](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/7/4436.abstract) [demonstrated](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/7/4141.full) links in tool use and innovation to brain size in primates. Kidd and Piantadosi’s new idea is that increased helplessness in newborns mandates increased intelligence in parents—and that a runaway selection dynamic can account for both. Natural selection favors humans with large brains, because those humans tend to be smarter. This may create evolutionary incentives for babies that are born at an even earlier developmental stage, which require more intelligence to raise. This creates the dynamic: over time, helpless babies make parents more intelligent, which makes babies more helpless, which makes their parents more intelligent, and so on.\n\n\n\nDuring their investigation, Kidd and Piantadosi realized something important that strengthened their theory. It turns out that another variable has an even higher correlation with intelligence than brain size—time to maturity, or weaning time. In other words, the time it takes to shepherd newborns through absolute helplessness to a point of relative self-sufficiency predicts primate intelligence more strongly than the best measure that has previously been proposed, namely, head circumference. Orangutans have smarter babies than baboons and they wean them longer. Baboon babies, in turn, are weaned longer, and are smarter, than lemur babies.\n\n\n\nPutting these facts together helped Kidd and Piantadosi develop their hypothesis. The connection between head size and intelligence does create incentives for babies to arrive earlier. But it’s the connection between weaning time and intelligence that may really be driving the cycle. You need to be smarter to care for more helpless creatures, which means you need a larger brain—which means that babies have to enter the world at an even more helpless stage of development, since there is a finite size to their brain at birth, mandated by the physiology of live birth. And so the cycle continues.\n\n\n\nOf course, the theory is just that—a model. Ideally, to prove it you would look at head size, birth time, and intelligence over the span of human evolution, to see if we were born earlier as we got smarter—data that are unavailable. (Kidd also stresses repeatedly that this theory supplements, but does not supplant, earlier ones: it can coexist quite naturally with both the social-group account of intelligence—the Dunbar approach—and what’s called the metabolic accounts of intelligence, which posits that our [digestive](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1520-6505(2000)9:4%3C156::AID-EVAN5%3E3.0.CO;2-7/abstract) system has [allowed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2744104?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) for our brain’s high metabolic needs, and that we grew smarter to be able to find and share difficult-to-gather food.) But there are some intriguing converging pieces of evidence. For one, other animals that are _not_ viviparous have not evolved the same levels of intelligence, suggesting an inherent link between live birth and brainpower. And in modern humans, a few pieces of evidence appear to suggest that smarter parents are more likely to have offspring that survive. In [one limited sample](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690800041X)—two hundred and twenty-two Serbian Roma women—maternal I.Q. and child mortality were negatively correlated (that is, higher I.Q. meant lower mortality), even controlling for education, age, and a number of other factors. In a [larger sample](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2061300?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) of Californian parents, in 1978, years of education were linked to infant-mortality rates. Global epidemiological studies [suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3070762) a decrease in mortality that equals between seven and nine per cent for each year of a mother’s education. None of this is decisive, of course, but it is suggestive.\n\n\n\nThere is, of course, one follow-up question: Why did this cycle happen to humans and not to lemurs? When I asked Kidd about this, she told me that their theory cannot offer an answer—likely as not, it’s a matter of pure genetic luck that became self-reinforcing. As we grew smarter, we were better able to take care of our infants, so they could be born more helpless and allow us to grow even smarter.\n\n\n\nOne intriguing way to test the hypothesis further: look at twins. Typically, twins are not carried to full term. Does that mean that twins are more intelligent than non-twins, since they require longer weaning time—and would a mother who is a twin, in turn, give birth to smarter children? “It’s a really good question, to look at the types of twins that run in families and whether that leads to higher intelligence,” Kidd said. “It’s a predictable hypothesis,” and one that they may well include in their ongoing research on train heritability in twins. And it’s a hypothesis that came, of all places, from a five-year-old—Kidd was being interviewed about twins for a \n\n+++podcast\n\n[#iframe: http://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=](100%x120)\n\n+++\n\n\n\n----------\n\n(http://www.scienceknocks.com/) by the daughter of Sindya Bhanoo, a former columnist at the _Times_.

There’s evidence that many aspects of personality develop quite early in life and have a genetic component, but we don’t become actively political until we are older. So it’s sensible to assume that the one might have some bearing on the other. But most of the work on the subject in the past decades has consisted merely of scientists conducting surveys and observing correlations. Few researchers have ever asked whether what they’re seeing actually implies causality or if the correlations are even meaningful. (The fact that correlation does not equal causation has been amply illustrated by a self-styled correlation debunker, [Tyler Vigen](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations); a recent visit to his eponymous Web site shows a 0.998 regional correlation between U.S. spending on science and technology and suicides by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation.) And so, almost a decade ago, Brad Verhulst, a behavioral geneticist now at Virginia Commonwealth University, asked himself just that: Is the personality-politics link truly causal? A relationship between personality and political leanings is “a completely reasonable thing to expect,” he told me when we spoke recently. He wanted to use his knowledge as a geneticist to explore the causal linkage that he was certain would be there.\n\n\n\nHe found something quite different. “Unfortunately, the empirical evidence doesn’t seem to support that strong causal hypothesis,” he said. In an [analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809096/) of 28,877 people from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (known as the Virginia 30,000), and then in a second, separate [longitudinal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347987/) that followed a group of more than eight thousand twins and siblings for ten years, he found no evidence of any form of causation. Instead, he found a relationship that was more complicated. It is far more likely that politics and personality traits are both influenced by some earlier genetic and environmental factors. In other words, they may indeed be related, but the fact that someone is liberal does not make him more tolerant, for instance, just as being tolerant does not make someone liberal.\n\n\n\nIn the first sample (the Virginia 30,000) Verhulst and his collaborators found that, while some modest correlations did exist between certain traits and attitudes—for example, between conservative economic views and measures of neuroticism—there was no evidence that there was anything causal to the correlations. But genetic analyses can be tricky. So Verhulst and Peter Hatemi tried a longitudinal study: follow people over time, map their personality and political leanings, and see if changes in the one cause changes in the other. They looked at two samples, one of adults (7,610 twins and siblings who were between the ages of nineteen and seventy-eight in 1980) and one of adolescents (1,061 twins and siblings who were between sixteen and nineteen in 1998). Each group had been tested in two waves, ten years apart. At both points, researchers looked at political attitudes (views on topics such as abortion and gay marriage, as well as responses to statements such as “I believe we should look to our religious authorities for decisions on moral issues”) and personality measures. They found that personality did shift over time—not by huge amounts, but perceptibly. People could become more or less extroverted, more agreeable or conscientious, or any number of things. Political attitudes were slightly more stable, among both the adolescents and the adults: people who were conservative tended to stay conservative. And, most important, changes in personality did not predict changes in politics. “We conclude that both personality traits and political attitudes are independently part of one’s psychological architecture,” the authors write.\n\n\n\nNone of this work denies the possible existence of correlations between some traits and some beliefs, but it does raise the question of what those correlations signify—especially since, setting aside the issue of causality, some early research on politics and personality may have overstated the connections because of a built-in tautology. As it turns out, in many of the early conceptions of personality traits political leanings were purposefully built into the survey questions used to assess personality. Early theorists explicitly wanted to capture political attitudes with their scales. For instance, in order to measure “openness,” Robert McCrae and Paul Costa, the creators of one of the most widely used [personality measures](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/019188699290236I), the NEO-PI-R, use “favors conservative values” as one of the items to assess the degree to which someone possesses a trait. In measures of agreeableness, there are items like “we can never do too much for the poor and elderly” and “human need should always take priority over economic considerations”—both statements that are embedded in a specific political ideology. In other words, our political beliefs are actually used to assess our level of the trait. By definition, we are higher on openness, say, if we are politically liberal.\n\n\n\nThat circularity, however, is often lost on modern minds. So what happens when we look for correlations between, say, openness and liberalism? We find one because it’s largely tautological. It doesn’t help that most of the scales are proprietary and, hence, not publicly available: it’s hard to find a list of items that contribute to each facet and, therefore, to see for yourself just how embedded politics already are in traits that people mainly think of as abstract concepts.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Verhulst if it was possible to circumvent this, he pointed out two things: first, not all traits are tautological (openness is the most egregious example). If you wanted to study risk-taking, for instance, you could conceivably avoid any sort of circularity. And, second, some people try to remove the political items—but with mixed results. “If you are concerned with political attitudes, you might remove items that are explicitly political,” he told me. “But just because you’ve taken those out doesn’t mean you’ve fundamentally changed what openness measures. Even if you’re removing some of the completely tautological items, you aren’t quite hitting that problem.” So in his studies Verhulst also used an entirely different scale, one that is “relatively untainted by explicitly political items,” as he and his co-authors write. The non-causal correlations he does find are in the weak 0.2–0.4 range. (A perfect correlation is 1; 0.2 is [considered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576830/) “negligible,” while 0.4 is “low.”)\n\n\n\nBut the desire for causality, or at least some basic truths—_Of course those Republicans are closed-minded people! Of course those damn Democrats are neurotic!_—persists. And despite studies like Verhulst’s, we can’t seem to let it go. Headlines keep appearing; researchers keep pointing it out. Verhulst’s 2012 paper—the analysis of the Virginia 30,000—was recently in the news because of an authorial [correction](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12216/full). It seems that one of the minor correlational directions had been reversed: it was liberals, not conservatives, who scored slightly higher on a measure of psychoticism, which takes into account aggressiveness, antisocial tendencies, and egocentricity, among other traits. (“[Science Says Liberals, Not Conservatives, Are Psychotic](http://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/),” the New York _Post_ wrote.) In the correction note, Verhulst, Hatemi, and a co-author, Lindon Eaves, stressed that the error, while regrettable and sloppy, didn’t actually affect any of the paper’s main conclusions: that there was no causality between personality and politics, and that correlations were small. Really, neither liberals nor conservatives are particularly likely to display traits of psychoticism, and, to the extent that liberals are, it’s no more related to their politics than to their shirt size. “We found no evidence that personality traits play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes,” the authors [write](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691630407X). “Our focus and novel results showed that whatever the directions of the correlations are between personality traits and attitudes, the relationships are spurious.” And so, while it of course needed to be fixed, at the end of the day it didn’t matter all that much.\n\n\n\nOthers in the [media](https://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/) and in politics thought otherwise. At least in the U.S., the party you believe in plays a big role in how you conceive of yourself. It feels good to think that your party is smarter, and that the smarts are what drive people to your party. It also feels good to say that the other guys are psychos. “ ‘It’s spurious, there’s no causal relationship,’ ” Verhulst says. “That could be pretty depressing for people who’ve invested a lot of time in this.” Here’s what won’t make a good headline: “Small and Spurious Correlation Shown to Have Been Backward, but It Doesn’t Matter That Much, Because the Point of the Paper Was That There Is No Underlying Causation After All.”\n\n\n\nSocial psychology touches on our most cherished beliefs about how the world _should_ operate. We are more than happy to accept the counterintuitive—as long as it doesn’t conflict with our central notions of what ought to be. And, when it comes to politics, it can be awfully difficult to put your desires aside and to acknowledge that the world is a much messier place, where open-minded people might be conservative and liberals may well be conscientious. “People get passionate when they’re talking about these things,” Verhulst points out. “It would be nice if it was less passionate, but political values really do have a profound impact on our daily lives, as do the personality traits we have. They are fundamentally striking at what it means to be human.” And so levelheadedness remains difficult. Here’s a headline you’re not so likely to see: “Conservatives Are from Earth, Liberals Are from Earth, and Scientists Aren’t Really Sure About How They End Up That Way.”","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/politics-and-personality-most-of-what-you-read-is-malarkey","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

No one ever says that they want to work in a negative environment, after all, or even in a blasé one. And yet, in late April, the National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling against T-Mobile for that very aspiration: the telecommunications company had run afoul of the law by including a provision in its employee handbook requiring workers “to maintain a positive work environment in a manner that is conducive to effective working relationships.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was, of course, a perfectly sound legal reason for this seemingly odd decision. The ruling was the culmination of a series of charges that had been brought against the company in the course of several years, during which the N.L.R.B. struck down multiple T-Mobile policies that appeared to hamper union organization and other, more benign efforts to discuss employment practices. The wording in the employee manual regarding the “positive work environment,” the board held, was “ambiguous and vague” enough to have a chilling effect on the right of employees to speak freely and to organize, rights guaranteed under the National Labor Relations Act. Because the “positive work environment” was never explicitly described, workers would have to err on the side of over-sensitivity—steering clear of “potentially controversial but protected communication in the workplace,” as the ruling put it—lest they be punished.\n\n\n\nThe law has its own imperatives, but if you took the same work-environment mandate and put it through a different intellectual grinder—in this case, social science—would you come up with a different result? If we agree that a positive environment is a worthy goal, we still have to agree on how, exactly, to foster such an environment. Research certainly suggests that people thrive in positive and supportive spaces: they are happy and satisfied; they [are](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3141585/) [motivated](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/97/1/134) and optimistic, setting higher goals and working harder and longer; they are [creative](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984303001000); they are less likely to [burn out](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0097840X.1986.9936762) and more likely to stick with a company or project. But can you actually create positivity by mandating it?\n\n\n\n“It sounds really nice. It sounds like they’re creating a civil workplace,” Alicia Grandey, an organizational psychologist at Penn State who studies emotional labor, told me when I asked her about positive-environment provisions such as T-Mobile’s. But Grandey cautions that it is incredibly difficult to impose positivity from the top and actually exert a positive effect. “When anything feels forced or externally controlled, it doesn’t tend to be as beneficial as when it’s coming from the self,” she said. “The irony is, when you’re trying to get people to do something positive, you can’t do it. Once it’s required, it’s fake and forced.” What you create instead is a negative backlash. “It feels like Big Brother.”\n\n\n\nWorrying about whether or not you’re in violation of a feel-good policy and constantly monitoring yourself for slipups takes a mental toll. More than two decades of research suggests that thought [suppression](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027273580000057X), or trying to stifle your initial impulses in favor of something else, can result in [mental strain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751965) and may also impair other types of thinking—[memory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/PP.70.5.924), [self-control](https://www.newyorker.com/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/Outlook%20Temp/psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/78/4/753), [problem solving](http://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4/abstract), motivation, perceptiveness. When we are actively monitoring ourselves, our mental energy for other things suffers. The result is not only a less-than-positive work environment but also workers who are less-than-optimally productive. In other words, it’s bad business.\n\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/590978c6019dfc3494ea3178]\n\n+++\n\n\n\nSuch behavior-limiting regulations may inhibit thinking and sap initiative and drive. In 2004, the psychologists Myeong-Gu Seo, Lisa Feldman Barrett, and Jean Bartunek [posited](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1519413/) a connection between employees' emotional experience in the workplace and their resulting levels of motivation. According to their model, our feelings affect behavior along a continuum between, on one end, something they term “generativeness” (that is, how likely you are to explore something that may end up having a good result, if doing so involves risk) and, on the other, “defensiveness” (when you are focussed on avoiding negative outcomes, forgoing opportunities in the process). It’s a concept akin to what the Columbia University psychologist Tory Higgins calls promotion and prevention—that is, the decision to work toward something or to direct your energy toward avoiding something else. When we are constantly monitoring our behavior, we tend to be on guard and act defensively. We tend to prevent rather than to promote.\n\n\n\nEven more salient, Grandey argues, is the feeling of inauthenticity that enforced emotional displays create. In her [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21875210), she has found that putting on an emotional mask at work—conforming to a certain image that doesn’t necessarily correspond to how you feel or who you are—drains you of energy that can only be replenished if you then have an opportunity to be yourself. “You have to be able to be real,” she told me. “If we’re expecting people to be super happy and positive to people you’re expected to be positive with as part of your job”—to smile and act upbeat with clients and customers—“if you can’t turn around and be real with co-workers, you are amplifying emotional labor. And you have a real problem on your hands.”\n\n\n\nEveryone wants a civil workplace, but demanding that your workers be positive may be an uncivil thing to do. It may be especially so when it comes to broad and sweeping pronouncements, as in T-Mobile’s case. [Last year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841467), a group of researchers decided to explore whether there were _any_ policies aimed at emotional management in a workplace that would actually succeed. To answer that question, they had three hundred and eighty-two employees, from a number of retail stores, rate the degree of explicitness of the rules governing their emotional behavior at work: on the one end are vague, ambiguous admonitions such as “be positive,” without any guidelines; on the other end are explicit rules that govern when you should smile, what you should say, and the like. The researchers then observed how motivated the employees were and how customers responded to them.\n\n\n\nWhat they found was an inverted-U relationship between rule explicitness and effectiveness: if rules were overly vague or overly prescriptive, they had a demotivating effect. (Customers, too, were disappointed, giving both employees and their shopping experiences lower ratings.) Where the rules generally had their intended effect was in the moderate range: when there were some explicit guidelines, but flexibility in how they were to be implemented. A second study, of a hundred and seventy-five salespeople, found the relationship to hold for sales numbers as well: sales were higher in environments with moderate rules, while environments with too few or too many rules suffered. The highest performers of all were those in a moderately regulated environment who also felt a high degree of autonomy, as determined by their responses to a single statement: “My job permits me to decide on my own how to go about doing the work.” In other words, people want to feel in control. They want to be afforded respect and to determine on their own how to act; it is this autonomy that helps foster emotional positivity. Grandey suggests we are all still a bit like our two-year-old selves: tell a toddler exactly what to do and what not to do, and she balks. Let her figure it out within a certain framework, and she is happy.\n\n\n\nSo it turns out that enforcing a generalized positivity can create problems in the realm of psychological motivation as well as in the legal realm. The issue of how to encourage workplace positivity raises another problem, which is the possibility of suppressing freedom of expression. In asking for a “positive” environment, you can promote your own agenda and reprimand anyone who doesn’t fit with your concept of positivity at that particular moment. In T-Mobile’s case, enforcing a positive environment might have been a way of preventing a very specific type of speech and action, namely anything that was critical of the employer or trying to promote employee rights. Similar dynamics have arisen in non-corporate settings. In recent years, we’ve seen a trend toward prescribing what someone can or can’t say in order to protect a subjective notion of how it makes someone else feel. This is most obviously happening on college campuses, in the guise of microaggressions, triggers, and their ilk; in some cases, the [effects of checking](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/the-new-activism-of-liberal-arts-colleges) one’s speech can be to reasonably protect members of the community, but in others the fear of offense can create anxiety and can even become a kind of censorship. T-Mobile’s positive-environment clause is, essentially, a grownup version of the “safe space” that is only safe for the people who’ve created it, not for those with contrary opinions.\n\n\n\nAnd yet the ruling itself gives us cause to be truly positive: after all, the N.L.R.B. decided against T-Mobile. One can only hope—positively, optimistically hope—that the decision presages a broader understanding of a deeper truth: we all deserve a positive environment, but that very positivity is at risk when we try to force it rather than fostering it by example.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/what-makes-people-feel-upbeat-at-work","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

You’ve maybe even quoted them, especially now that it’s election season. “[Conservatives More Susceptible to Bullshit Than Liberals](https://reason.com/blog/2016/05/17/conservatives-more-susceptible-to-bullsh).” “[Study: Are Liberals Smarter Than Conservatives](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1968042,00.html#ixzz0gw6qkclr)?” “[Studies: Conservatives Are from Mars, Liberals Are from Venus](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/studies-conservatives-are-from-mars-liberals-are-from-venus/252416/).” All of these tantalizing connections between personalities and politics sound academic if not downright scientific—they cite studies, after all—and, depending on your own political leanings, you’ve likely had one of two reactions: _Of course, I knew it!_ or _This is bogus!_ As it turns out, if you’re in the second camp you’re probably right—but maybe for a reason that’s different from what you thought.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many political psychologists, it seems [abundantly](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=1701816) [clear](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3792381?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that [traits and politics](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7449472) go together. There’s evidence that many aspects of personality develop quite early in life and have a genetic component, but we don’t become actively political until we are older. So it’s sensible to assume that the one might have some bearing on the other. But most of the work on the subject in the past decades has consisted merely of scientists conducting surveys and observing correlations. Few researchers have ever asked whether what they’re seeing actually implies causality or if the correlations are even meaningful. (The fact that correlation does not equal causation has been amply illustrated by a self-styled correlation debunker, [Tyler Vigen](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations); a recent visit to his eponymous Web site shows a 0.998 regional correlation between U.S. spending on science and technology and suicides by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation.) And so, almost a decade ago, Brad Verhulst, a behavioral geneticist now at Virginia Commonwealth University, asked himself just that: Is the personality-politics link truly causal? A relationship between personality and political leanings is “a completely reasonable thing to expect,” he told me when we spoke recently. He wanted to use his knowledge as a geneticist to explore the causal linkage that he was certain would be there.\n\n\n\nHe found something quite different. “Unfortunately, the empirical evidence doesn’t seem to support that strong causal hypothesis,” he said. In an [analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809096/) of 28,877 people from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (known as the Virginia 30,000), and then in a second, separate [longitudinal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347987/) that followed a group of more than eight thousand twins and siblings for ten years, he found no evidence of any form of causation. Instead, he found a relationship that was more complicated. It is far more likely that politics and personality traits are both influenced by some earlier genetic and environmental factors. In other words, they may indeed be related, but the fact that someone is liberal does not make him more tolerant, for instance, just as being tolerant does not make someone liberal.\n\n\n\nIn the first sample (the Virginia 30,000) Verhulst and his collaborators found that, while some modest correlations did exist between certain traits and attitudes—for example, between conservative economic views and measures of neuroticism—there was no evidence that there was anything causal to the correlations. But genetic analyses can be tricky. So Verhulst and Peter Hatemi tried a longitudinal study: follow people over time, map their personality and political leanings, and see if changes in the one cause changes in the other. They looked at two samples, one of adults (7,610 twins and siblings who were between the ages of nineteen and seventy-eight in 1980) and one of adolescents (1,061 twins and siblings who were between sixteen and nineteen in 1998). Each group had been tested in two waves, ten years apart. At both points, researchers looked at political attitudes (views on topics such as abortion and gay marriage, as well as responses to statements such as “I believe we should look to our religious authorities for decisions on moral issues”) and personality measures. They found that personality did shift over time—not by huge amounts, but perceptibly. People could become more or less extroverted, more agreeable or conscientious, or any number of things. Political attitudes were slightly more stable, among both the adolescents and the adults: people who were conservative tended to stay conservative. And, most important, changes in personality did not predict changes in politics. “We conclude that both personality traits and political attitudes are independently part of one’s psychological architecture,” the authors write.\n\n\n\nNone of this work denies the possible existence of correlations between some traits and some beliefs, but it does raise the question of what those correlations signify—especially since, setting aside the issue of causality, some early research on politics and personality may have overstated the connections because of a built-in tautology. As it turns out, in many of the early conceptions of personality traits political leanings were purposefully built into the survey questions used to assess personality. Early theorists explicitly wanted to capture political attitudes with their scales. For instance, in order to measure “openness,” Robert McCrae and Paul Costa, the creators of one of the most widely used [personality measures](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/019188699290236I), the NEO-PI-R, use “favors conservative values” as one of the items to assess the degree to which someone possesses a trait. In measures of agreeableness, there are items like “we can never do too much for the poor and elderly” and “human need should always take priority over economic considerations”—both statements that are embedded in a specific political ideology. In other words, our political beliefs are actually used to assess our level of the trait. By definition, we are higher on openness, say, if we are politically liberal.\n\n\n\nThat circularity, however, is often lost on modern minds. So what happens when we look for correlations between, say, openness and liberalism? We find one because it’s largely tautological. It doesn’t help that most of the scales are proprietary and, hence, not publicly available: it’s hard to find a list of items that contribute to each facet and, therefore, to see for yourself just how embedded politics already are in traits that people mainly think of as abstract concepts.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Verhulst if it was possible to circumvent this, he pointed out two things: first, not all traits are tautological (openness is the most egregious example). If you wanted to study risk-taking, for instance, you could conceivably avoid any sort of circularity. And, second, some people try to remove the political items—but with mixed results. “If you are concerned with political attitudes, you might remove items that are explicitly political,” he told me. “But just because you’ve taken those out doesn’t mean you’ve fundamentally changed what openness measures. Even if you’re removing some of the completely tautological items, you aren’t quite hitting that problem.” So in his studies Verhulst also used an entirely different scale, one that is “relatively untainted by explicitly political items,” as he and his co-authors write. The non-causal correlations he does find are in the weak 0.2–0.4 range. (A perfect correlation is 1; 0.2 is [considered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576830/) “negligible,” while 0.4 is “low.”)\n\n\n\nBut the desire for causality, or at least some basic truths—_Of course those Republicans are closed-minded people! Of course those damn Democrats are neurotic!_—persists. And despite studies like Verhulst’s, we can’t seem to let it go. Headlines keep appearing; researchers keep pointing it out. Verhulst’s 2012 paper—the analysis of the Virginia 30,000—was recently in the news because of an authorial [correction](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12216/full). It seems that one of the minor correlational directions had been reversed: it was liberals, not conservatives, who scored slightly higher on a measure of psychoticism, which takes into account aggressiveness, antisocial tendencies, and egocentricity, among other traits. (“[Science Says Liberals, Not Conservatives, Are Psychotic](http://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/),” the New York _Post_ wrote.) In the correction note, Verhulst, Hatemi, and a co-author, Lindon Eaves, stressed that the error, while regrettable and sloppy, didn’t actually affect any of the paper’s main conclusions: that there was no causality between personality and politics, and that correlations were small. Really, neither liberals nor conservatives are particularly likely to display traits of psychoticism, and, to the extent that liberals are, it’s no more related to their politics than to their shirt size. “We found no evidence that personality traits play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes,” the authors [write](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691630407X). “Our focus and novel results showed that whatever the directions of the correlations are between personality traits and attitudes, the relationships are spurious.” And so, while it of course needed to be fixed, at the end of the day it didn’t matter all that much.\n\n\n\nOthers in the [media](https://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/) and in politics thought otherwise. At least in the U.S., the party you believe in plays a big role in how you conceive of yourself. It feels good to think that your party is smarter, and that the smarts are what drive people to your party. It also feels good to say that the other guys are psychos. “ ‘It’s spurious, there’s no causal relationship,’ ” Verhulst says. “That could be pretty depressing for people who’ve invested a lot of time in this.” Here’s what won’t make a good headline: “Small and Spurious Correlation Shown to Have Been Backward, but It Doesn’t Matter That Much, Because the Point of the Paper Was That There Is No Underlying Causation After All.”\n\n\n\nSocial psychology touches on our most cherished beliefs about how the world _should_ operate. We are more than happy to accept the counterintuitive—as long as it doesn’t conflict with our central notions of what ought to be. And, when it comes to politics, it can be awfully difficult to put your desires aside and to acknowledge that the world is a much messier place, where open-minded people might be conservative and liberals may well be conscientious. “People get passionate when they’re talking about these things,” Verhulst points out. “It would be nice if it was less passionate, but political values really do have a profound impact on our daily lives, as do the personality traits we have. They are fundamentally striking at what it means to be human.” And so levelheadedness remains difficult. Here’s a headline you’re not so likely to see: “Conservatives Are from Earth, Liberals Are from Earth, and Scientists Aren’t Really Sure About How They End Up That Way.”","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/politics-and-personality-most-of-what-you-read-is-malarkey","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Psychology","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"},{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

From time to time, their caretakers give them tokens, which they can then exchange for food. It’s a truth universally acknowledged that capuchin monkeys prefer grapes to cucumbers. So what happens when unfairness strikes—when, in exchange for identical tokens, one monkey gets a cucumber and the other a grape?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal [carried out](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6955/full/nature01963.html) just this experiment, in 2003, focussing on female capuchin monkeys, they found that monkeys hate being disadvantaged. A monkey in isolation is happy to eat either a grape or a slice of cucumber. But a monkey who sees that she’s received a cucumber while her partner has gotten a grape reacts with anger: she might hurl her cucumber from her cage. Some primates, Brosnan and de Waal concluded, “dislike inequity.” They hate getting the short end of the stick. Psychologists have a technical term for this reaction: they call it “disadvantageous-inequity aversion.” This instinctual aversion to getting less than others has been found in [chimpanzees](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210000631) and [dogs](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/1/340), and it occurs, of course, in people, in whom it seems to develop from a young age. The psychologists Alessandra Geraci and Luca Surian have [found](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01048.x/abstract), for example, that babies as young as twelve months prefer fair-minded cartoon animals to unfair ones.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, for humans, an aversion to getting less is just one aspect of unfairness. Unlike other animals, we sometimes balk at receiving _more_ than other people. Technically speaking, we experience “advantageous-inequity aversion.” In some situations, we’ll even give up something good because it’s more than someone else is getting. In those moments, we seek to insure that the distribution of goods remains fair. We don’t want the long end of the stick, either.\n\n\n\nIt seems likely that our aversion to being disadvantaged is innate, because we share it with other animals. The question for psychologists is whether our aversion to _benefitting_ from inequality is innate, too—or, alternatively, if it’s learned through some form of socialization. In December, the psychologists Peter Blake, Katherine McAuliffe, Felix Warneken, and their colleagues [published](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature15703.html) the results of experiments designed to answer this question. Their research spanned seven nations—India, Uganda, Peru, Senegal, Mexico, Canada, and the United States—and looked at close to nine hundred children, aged four to fifteen. They examined whether advantageous-inequity aversion—A.I., as they call it—emerges in all cultures, and, if it does, whether it emerges in the same way everywhere.\n\n\n\nTheir method was relatively simple. They sat two children down at a table, each in front of an empty bowl. Above each bowl was a tray, onto which the experimenter placed candy. Often, she distributed candy unfairly: she might place four candies on one tray and only one on the other. The child being tested then faced a choice. She could pull a green handle to accept the presented candies, causing them to fall into their respective bowls—or she could pull a red handle to reject them, causing all the candies to fall into a third, off-limits bowl, in the center.\n\n\n\nThe researchers found that, all over the world, children tended to reject the candies when the split favored the other child. (That is, they rejected disadvantageous inequity, or D.I.) They also found that some, older kids would reject _advantageous_ offers. None of that is surprising. A.I. has been documented among adults many times in the past; in [one early study](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/keith.chen/negot.%20papers/LoewThompBazer_SocUtilDecMake89.pdf), from behavioral economist George Loewenstein and his colleagues, as many as sixty-six per cent of participants disliked getting more than someone else. The surprising part is that the kids only displayed A.I. in three countries: Canada, the United States, and Uganda. In the other countries—Mexico, India, Senegal, and Peru—they enjoyed the sweet taste of inequality.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThese results raise some fascinating questions. Why were kids from only certain countries bothered by having an unfair advantage? And were they rejecting those unfair offers because they cared about fairness—or for some other, less obvious reason?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s helpful to start by stepping back from the more complicated case of A.I. to the simpler case of D.I. There are lots of reasons to object to disadvantageous inequity, and some are more obvious than others. D.I. is bad substantively, of course, because you get less candy. But it’s also bad socially, because it signals a demotion in status. In fact, when kids reject disadvantageous offers, they’re often most concerned about their social status, rather than with the candy itself, or with abstract ideas like equality. It’s not about right or wrong. It’s all about _me_: how do I come off in this scenario?\n\n\n\nThe importance of social hierarchy in the rejection of disadvantageous unfairness has been cleverly demonstrated in several experiments. In [one study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027713002102), the psychologists Mark Sheskin, Paul Bloom, and Karen Wynn had kids choose between getting one token and giving one to another child, or getting two tokens and giving three to the other kid. “You might think that the latter is the better choice because both children get more,” Bloom writes, in his book “Just Babies.” Often, though, the children chose the first option—just one token each—insuring that they wouldn’t get less than someone else.\n\n\n\nIn another version of the study, Bloom and his colleagues offered a choice between two tokens all around, or one for the subject and _none_ for her counterpart. Five- and six-year-olds preferred the second option: that is, they gave up a reward in exchange for having more than their peers. “We have a natural aversion to getting less—not to inequity,” Bloom told me. The kids’ behavior isn’t principled; on the contrary, Bloom believes, it seems motivated by something very much like spite. And the message is clear: I want to emerge on top. The absolute number of candies matters less than my relative status.\n\n\n\nIf D.I. is really about status rather than fairness, could A.I. be about status, too? Rejecting an _advantageous_ offer, after all, also sends a social signal. If you live in a society where ideas of fairness and equality hold a privileged position, then it becomes meaningful to show yourself as embracing those ideals, even at personal cost. Those around you might feel that, since you’re the type of person who believes in equity no matter what, you’re valuable to society, and worthy of respect. From this perspective, both D.I. and A.I. achieve the same end: making sure you maintain status. Perhaps, for older kids who are transitioning into adolescence, status doesn’t always come from having more. It could also flow from being an admirable role model.\n\n\n\nIf status really is the driving force behind both D.I. and A.I., it would explain one of the study’s relative outliers: Mexico. When the experiment was run there, very few of the children exhibited A.I.; moreover, D.I. appeared to develop far later than in other societies. The Mexican children, in other words, tended to accept all offers, however unequal in any direction. The authors point out that, in that particular sample, most of the kids already knew each other. Perhaps they had already developed reputations, and, as a result, what happened in the experiment had no real implications for their social hierarchy. They were free to enjoy the candy all by itself, without social signals on the side.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nStill, even if A.I. and D.I. have a lot in common—even if they’re both about status—the research from Blake and his colleagues suggests that they are different in at least one fundamental way. D.I. is innate: all over the world, and in the animal kingdom, getting less than others is perceived as an insult. A.I., on the other hand, seems to be a product of social life or culture. Globally, at least among children, it appears to be very unevenly distributed. In Canada, the United States, and Uganda, the study shows that older kids are _more_ likely, on average, to reject an advantageous offer than an equal offer. By contrast, in Mexico, Peru, India, and Senegal, they willingly accept getting more. In the past, studies of A.I. have focussed on so-called *WEIRD*{: .small} societies—Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. As a result, the uneven distribution of A.I. went beneath the radar.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explain its uneven distribution, Blake and his colleagues point to a number of potential causes. The most prominent is “Western norms.” They suggest that advantageous-equity aversion is more prevalent in Western societies because, in the West, equality and the abstract notion of “fairness” are valued as goods in their own right; it’s only within that framework that sacrificing your self-interest in the name of fairness comes to be linked with status. (In recent years, of course, Western societies have been wrestling with the problem of rising inequality—an irony on which the researchers choose not to dwell.) In an [earlier study](http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0080966&representation=PDF), McAuliffe, Blake, Warneken, and their colleagues found that, while subjects exhibited D.I. even in the absence of a visible partner, A.I. only emerged in social situations. This suggests that A.I. might require certain kinds of social environments to thrive.\n\n\n\nIf it’s Western culture that encourages A.I., then why is it so common in Uganda? Blake and his colleagues posit that the answer lies in the specific subset of the Ugandan population they surveyed. They recruited children from schools that had Western teachers, and in which students were frequently exposed to Western researchers. Perhaps, they write, that environment had changed the students’ sense of fairness. This reasoning seems a bit thin: aren’t other societies also exposed to Western norms, especially in the modern age of ubiquitous smartphones and mass media? “It remains possible that children in Uganda reject an advantage for other reasons not linked to Western norms,” the authors write. “If this is the case, we would expect to see A.I. emerge in children in other communities in Uganda with similar cultural norms but different institutional structures.”\n\n\n\nBehind the question of how “Western” A.I. is, a broader question looms. What factors in society could create a norm whereby it’s valuable to establish yourself publicly as someone who doesn’t want to receive more than others? In the same set of studies in which he found that, under some circumstances, up to sixty-six per cent of adults experienced A.I., George Loewenstein tried to tease out what conditions might give rise to advantageous-inequality aversion in the first place. He started by asking subjects to imagine themselves in a specific business scenario. In the first scenario, they had invented a new type of ski with someone; in another, they were splitting tax revenue from a vacant lot with a neighbor; and, in a third, they were in conflict with a sales manager at a retail outlet. In each of these scenarios, their preëxisting relationship with their counterpart was described as positive, negative, or neutral, and the financial payments were either equal or representative of disadvantageous or advantageous inequity. As expected, when it came to D.I., pretty much no one enjoyed receiving less than the co-inventor, business partner, or manager. A.I., by contrast, was unevenly distributed; in some situations, it was absent altogether. It emerged readily in the invention and vacant-lot scenarios—_if_ the preëxisting relationship was positive or neutral; it was relatively infrequent in the retail scenario; and, if the relationship was negative, it disappeared across the board. (In that case, people preferred to come out ahead of their counterparts.)\n\n\n\nBased on his participants’ choices, Loewenstein divided them into three groups: saints, loyalists, and ruthless competitors. Saints preferred equality over everything else; they were concerned with fairness for its own sake. Loyalists preferred equality in positive relationships, but, in negative ones, they sought A.I.—they approached the relationship socially, seeking to create loyalty by giving up their unfair advantages. Ruthless competitors always preferred getting more. The relative percentages of the saints, loyalists, and ruthless competitors were twenty-four, twenty-seven, and thirty-six, respectively. (Eighteen per cent couldn’t be classified.) Then, in a follow-up, Loewenstein clarified the preëxisting relationships, providing his subjects with several paragraphs of explanation as to why those relationships were positive, negative, or neutral. Under that condition, the number of saints and ruthless competitors fell, while the proportion of loyalists rose to over half—fifty-two per cent.\n\n\n\nWhen participants received more context for the study’s social scenarios and became more invested in their relationships, in other words, they gave up more to nourish and maintain them. And they are wise to do so. The [results](http://fowler.ucsd.edu/egalitarian_motives.pdf) of another set of experiments show that the more someone earns in a context of inequality, the more hostile reactions from others she provokes. People dislike those at the top of the heap more when the heap itself is taller.\n\n\n\nAll of these findings have something to say about why we value fairness. Our ideas about fairness are relativistic, rather than absolute. In many ways, we approach fairness as a form of social signalling. People tend not to care about equality as an abstract principle; instead, they use fairness to negotiate their place in a social hierarchy. And, for that reason, we’re especially willing to give up our unfair advantages when there’s the possibility of strengthening a future relationship.\n\n\n\nCould these general principles explain why A.I. appears earlier or more often in some societies? Possibly, but there’s a lot more research to do before anything like a clear-cut answer emerges. One thing we do know is that culture plays a role—but what kind of culture? Can it be taught? Maybe, if we can figure out the answer to that question, we’ll be able to build a world where there are more saints and loyalists—and fewer ruthless competitors.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-we-learn-fairness","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e2c63b75f002c8941e8b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fairness","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fairness"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

They had followed a group of almost two thousand parents, all of whom had at least one child under the age of seventeen, to test a simple relationship: Could various pro-vaccination campaigns change parental attitudes toward vaccines? Each household received one of four messages: a leaflet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that there had been no evidence linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (M.M.R.) vaccine and autism; a leaflet from the Vaccine Information Statement on the dangers of the diseases that the M.M.R. vaccine prevents; photographs of children who had suffered from the diseases; and a dramatic story from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about an infant who almost died of measles. A control group did not receive any information at all. The goal was to test whether facts, science, emotions, or stories could make people change their minds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result was dramatic: a whole lot of nothing. None of the interventions worked. The first leaflet—focussed on a lack of evidence [connecting vaccines and autism](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/07/jenny-mccarthys-dangerous-views.html)—seemed to reduce misperceptions about the link, but it did nothing to affect intentions to vaccinate. It even decreased intent among parents who held the most negative attitudes toward vaccines, a phenomenon known as the [backfire effect](http://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2013/02000/The_Hazards_of_Correcting_Myths_About_Health_Care.2.aspx). The other two interventions fared even worse: the images of sick children increased the belief that vaccines cause autism, while the dramatic narrative somehow managed to increase beliefs about the dangers of vaccines. “It’s depressing,” Nyhan said. “We were definitely depressed,” he repeated, after a pause.\n\n\n\nNyhan’s interest in false beliefs dates back to early 2000, when he was a senior at Swarthmore. It was the middle of a messy Presidential campaign, and he was studying the intricacies of political science. “The 2000 campaign was something of a fact-free zone,” he said. Along with two classmates, Nyhan decided to try to create a forum dedicated to debunking political lies. The result was [Spinsanity](http://www.spinsanity.org/), a fact-checking site that presaged venues like [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/) and the Annenberg Policy Center’s factcheck.org. For four years, the trio plugged along. Their work was popular—it was syndicated by Salon and the Philadelphia _Inquirer_, and it led to a best-selling [book](http://www.amazon.com/All-Presidents-Spin-George-Media/dp/0743262514/)—but the errors persisted. And so Nyhan, who had already enrolled in a doctorate program in political science at Duke, left Spinsanity behind to focus on what he now sees as the more pressing issue: If factual correction is ineffective, how can you make people change their misperceptions? The 2014 vaccine study was part of a series of experiments designed to answer the question.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, attempts to correct false beliefs haven’t had much success. Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychologist at the University of Bristol whose [research into misinformation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15733198) began around the same time as Nyhan’s, conducted a [review](http://psi.sagepub.com/content/13/3/106.full) of misperception literature through 2012. He found much speculation, but, apart from his own work and the studies that Nyhan was conducting, there was little empirical research. In the past few years, Nyhan has tried to address this gap by using real-life scenarios and news in his studies: the controversy surrounding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the questioning of Obama’s birth certificate, and anti-G.M.O. activism. Traditional work in this area has focussed on fictional stories told in laboratory settings, but Nyhan believes that looking at real debates is the best way to learn how persistently incorrect views of the world can be corrected.\n\n\n\nOne thing he learned early on is that not all errors are created equal. Not all false information goes on to become a false belief—that is, a more lasting state of incorrect knowledge—and not all false beliefs are difficult to correct. Take astronomy. If someone asked you to explain the relationship between the Earth and the sun, you might say something wrong: perhaps that the sun rotates around the Earth, rising in the east and setting in the west. A friend who understands astronomy may correct you. It’s no big deal; you simply change your belief.\n\n\n\nBut imagine living in the time of Galileo, when understandings of the Earth-sun relationship were completely different, and when that view was tied closely to ideas of the nature of the world, the self, and religion. What would happen if Galileo tried to correct your belief? The process isn’t nearly as simple. The crucial difference between then and now, of course, is the importance of the misperception. When there’s no immediate threat to our understanding of the world, we change our beliefs. It’s when that change contradicts something we’ve long held as important that problems occur.\n\n\n\nIn those scenarios, attempts at correction can indeed be tricky. In a [study](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2441895) from 2013, Kelly Garrett and Brian Weeks looked to see if political misinformation—specifically, details about who is and is not allowed to access your electronic health records—that was corrected immediately would be any less resilient than information that was allowed to go uncontested for a while. At first, it appeared as though the correction did cause some people to change their false beliefs. But, when the researchers took a closer look, they found that the only people who had changed their views were those who were ideologically predisposed to disbelieve the fact in question. If someone held a contrary attitude, the correction not only didn’t work—it made the subject more distrustful of the source. A climate-change [study](http://crx.sagepub.com/content/39/6/701) from 2012 found a similar effect. Strong partisanship affected how a story about climate change was processed, even if the story was apolitical in nature, such as an article about possible health ramifications from a disease like the West Nile Virus, a potential side effect of change. If information doesn’t square with someone’s prior beliefs, he discards the beliefs if they’re weak and discards the information if the beliefs are strong.\n\n\n\nEven when we think we’ve properly corrected a false belief, the original exposure often continues to [influence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359617) our memory and thoughts. In a series of studies, Lewandowsky and his colleagues at the University of Western Australia asked university students to read the report of a liquor robbery that had ostensibly taken place in Australia’s Northern Territory. Everyone read the same report, but in some cases racial information about the perpetrators was included and in others it wasn’t. In one scenario, the students were led to believe that the suspects were Caucasian, and in another that they were Aboriginal. At the end of the report, the racial information either was or wasn’t retracted. Participants were then asked to take part in an unrelated computer task for half an hour. After that, they were asked a number of factual questions (“What sort of car was found abandoned?”) and inference questions (“Who do you think the attackers were?”). After the students answered all of the questions, they were given a scale to assess their racial attitudes toward Aboriginals.\n\n\n\nEveryone’s memory worked correctly: the students could all recall the details of the crime and could report precisely what information was or wasn’t retracted. But the students who scored highest on racial prejudice continued to rely on the racial misinformation that identified the perpetrators as Aboriginals, even though they knew it had been corrected. They answered the factual questions accurately, stating that the information about race was false, and yet they still relied on race in their inference responses, saying that the attackers were likely Aboriginal or that the store owner likely had trouble understanding them because they were Aboriginal. This was, in other words, a laboratory case of the very dynamic that Nyhan identified: strongly held beliefs continued to influence judgment, despite correction attempts—even with a supposedly conscious awareness of what was happening.\n\n\n\nIn a follow-up, Lewandowsky presented a scenario that was similar to the original experiment, except now, the Aboriginal was a hero who disarmed the would-be robber. This time, it was students who had scored lowest in racial prejudice who persisted in their reliance on false information, in spite of any attempt at correction. In their subsequent recollections, they mentioned race more frequently, and incorrectly, even though they knew that piece of information had been retracted. False beliefs, it turns out, have little to do with one’s stated political affiliations and far more to do with self-identity: What kind of person am I, and what kind of person do I want to be? All ideologies are similarly affected.\n\n\n\nIt’s the realization that persistently false beliefs stem from issues closely tied to our conception of self that prompted Nyhan and his colleagues to look at less traditional methods of rectifying misinformation. Rather than correcting or augmenting facts, they decided to target people’s beliefs about themselves. In a series of studies that they’ve just submitted for publication, the Dartmouth team approached false-belief correction from a self-affirmation angle, an approach that had previously been used for fighting prejudice and low self-esteem. The theory, [pioneered](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2000-07436-018) by Claude Steele, suggests that, when people feel their sense of self threatened by the outside world, they are strongly motivated to correct the misperception, be it by reasoning away the inconsistency or by modifying their behavior. For example, when women are asked to state their gender before taking a math or science test, they end up performing worse than if no such statement appears, conforming their behavior to societal beliefs about female math-and-science ability. To address this so-called stereotype threat, Steele proposes an exercise in self-affirmation: either write down or say aloud positive moments from your past that reaffirm your sense of self and are related to the threat in question. Steele’s research suggests that affirmation makes people far more resilient and high performing, be it on an S.A.T., an I.Q. test, or at a book-club meeting.\n\n\n\nNormally, self-affirmation is reserved for instances in which identity is threatened in direct ways: race, gender, age, weight, and the like. Here, Nyhan decided to apply it in an unrelated context: Could recalling a time when you felt good about yourself make you more broad-minded about highly politicized issues, like the Iraq surge or global warming? As it turns out, it would. On all issues, attitudes became more accurate with self-affirmation, and remained just as inaccurate without. That effect held even when no additional information was presented—that is, when people were simply asked the same questions twice, before and after the self-affirmation.\n\n\n\nStill, as Nyhan is the first to admit, it’s hardly a solution that can be applied easily outside the lab. “People don’t just go around writing essays about a time they felt good about themselves,” he said. And who knows how long the effect lasts—it’s not as though we often think good thoughts and then go on to debate climate change.\n\n\n\nBut, despite its unwieldiness, the theory may still be useful. Facts and evidence, for one, may not be the answer everyone thinks they are: they simply aren’t that effective, given how selectively they are processed and interpreted. Instead, why not focus on presenting issues in a way keeps broader notions out of it—messages that are not political, not ideological, not in any way a reflection of who you are?\n\n\n\nTake the example of [the burgeoning raw-milk movement](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/30/120430fa_fact_goodyear). So far, it’s a relatively fringe phenomenon, but if it spreads it threatens to undo the health benefits of more than a century of pasteurization. The C.D.C. calls raw milk “one of the world’s most dangerous food products,” noting that improperly handled raw milk is responsible for almost three times as many hospitalizations as any other food-borne illness. And yet raw-milk activists are becoming increasingly vocal—and the supposed health benefits of raw milk are gaining increased support. To prevent the idea from spreading even further, Nyhan advises, advocates of pasteurization shouldn’t dwell on the misperceptions, lest they “inadvertently draw more attention to the counterclaim.” Instead, they should create messaging that self-consciously avoids any broader issues of identity, pointing out, for example, that pasteurized milk has kept children healthy for a hundred years.\n\n\n\nI asked Nyhan if a similar approach would work with vaccines. He wasn’t sure—for the present moment, at least. “We may be past that point with vaccines,” he told me. “For now, while the issue is already so personalized in such a public way, it’s hard to find anything that will work.” The message that could be useful for raw milk, he pointed out, cuts another way in the current vaccine narrative: the diseases are bad, but people now believe that the vaccines, unlike pasteurized milk, are dangerous. The longer the narrative remains co-opted by prominent figures with little to no actual medical expertise—the [Jenny McCarthys](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/07/jenny-mccarthys-dangerous-views.html) of the world—the more difficult it becomes to find a unified, non-ideological theme. The message can’t change unless the perceived consensus among figures we see as opinion and thought leaders changes first.\n\n\n\nAnd that, ultimately, is the final, big piece of the puzzle: the cross-party, cross-platform unification of the country’s élites, those we perceive as opinion leaders, can make it possible for messages to spread broadly. The campaign against smoking is one of the most successful public-interest fact-checking operations in history. But, if smoking were just for Republicans or Democrats, change would have been far more unlikely. It’s only after ideology is put to the side that a message itself can change, so that it becomes decoupled from notions of self-perception.\n\n\n\nVaccines, fortunately, aren’t political. “They’re not inherently linked to ideology,” Nyhan said. “And that’s good. That means we can get to a consensus.” Ignoring vaccination, after all, can make people of every political party, and every religion, just as sick.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/i-dont-want-to-be-right","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ca3ee7fe02cbd16336e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"},{"id":"5c2e1d772bc86f2c9a244aab","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"techpages","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"techpages"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

No one ever says that they want to work in a negative environment, after all, or even in a blasé one. And yet, in late April, the National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling against T-Mobile for that very aspiration: the telecommunications company had run afoul of the law by including a provision in its employee handbook requiring workers “to maintain a positive work environment in a manner that is conducive to effective working relationships.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was, of course, a perfectly sound legal reason for this seemingly odd decision. The ruling was the culmination of a series of charges that had been brought against the company in the course of several years, during which the N.L.R.B. struck down multiple T-Mobile policies that appeared to hamper union organization and other, more benign efforts to discuss employment practices. The wording in the employee manual regarding the “positive work environment,” the board held, was “ambiguous and vague” enough to have a chilling effect on the right of employees to speak freely and to organize, rights guaranteed under the National Labor Relations Act. Because the “positive work environment” was never explicitly described, workers would have to err on the side of over-sensitivity—steering clear of “potentially controversial but protected communication in the workplace,” as the ruling put it—lest they be punished.\n\n\n\nThe law has its own imperatives, but if you took the same work-environment mandate and put it through a different intellectual grinder—in this case, social science—would you come up with a different result? If we agree that a positive environment is a worthy goal, we still have to agree on how, exactly, to foster such an environment. Research certainly suggests that people thrive in positive and supportive spaces: they are happy and satisfied; they [are](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3141585/) [motivated](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/97/1/134) and optimistic, setting higher goals and working harder and longer; they are [creative](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984303001000); they are less likely to [burn out](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0097840X.1986.9936762) and more likely to stick with a company or project. But can you actually create positivity by mandating it?\n\n\n\n“It sounds really nice. It sounds like they’re creating a civil workplace,” Alicia Grandey, an organizational psychologist at Penn State who studies emotional labor, told me when I asked her about positive-environment provisions such as T-Mobile’s. But Grandey cautions that it is incredibly difficult to impose positivity from the top and actually exert a positive effect. “When anything feels forced or externally controlled, it doesn’t tend to be as beneficial as when it’s coming from the self,” she said. “The irony is, when you’re trying to get people to do something positive, you can’t do it. Once it’s required, it’s fake and forced.” What you create instead is a negative backlash. “It feels like Big Brother.”\n\n\n\nWorrying about whether or not you’re in violation of a feel-good policy and constantly monitoring yourself for slipups takes a mental toll. More than two decades of research suggests that thought [suppression](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027273580000057X), or trying to stifle your initial impulses in favor of something else, can result in [mental strain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751965) and may also impair other types of thinking—[memory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/PP.70.5.924), [self-control](https://www.newyorker.com/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/Outlook%20Temp/psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/78/4/753), [problem solving](http://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4/abstract), motivation, perceptiveness. When we are actively monitoring ourselves, our mental energy for other things suffers. The result is not only a less-than-positive work environment but also workers who are less-than-optimally productive. In other words, it’s bad business.\n\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/590978c6019dfc3494ea3178]\n\n+++\n\n\n\nSuch behavior-limiting regulations may inhibit thinking and sap initiative and drive. In 2004, the psychologists Myeong-Gu Seo, Lisa Feldman Barrett, and Jean Bartunek [posited](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1519413/) a connection between employees' emotional experience in the workplace and their resulting levels of motivation. According to their model, our feelings affect behavior along a continuum between, on one end, something they term “generativeness” (that is, how likely you are to explore something that may end up having a good result, if doing so involves risk) and, on the other, “defensiveness” (when you are focussed on avoiding negative outcomes, forgoing opportunities in the process). It’s a concept akin to what the Columbia University psychologist Tory Higgins calls promotion and prevention—that is, the decision to work toward something or to direct your energy toward avoiding something else. When we are constantly monitoring our behavior, we tend to be on guard and act defensively. We tend to prevent rather than to promote.\n\n\n\nEven more salient, Grandey argues, is the feeling of inauthenticity that enforced emotional displays create. In her [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21875210), she has found that putting on an emotional mask at work—conforming to a certain image that doesn’t necessarily correspond to how you feel or who you are—drains you of energy that can only be replenished if you then have an opportunity to be yourself. “You have to be able to be real,” she told me. “If we’re expecting people to be super happy and positive to people you’re expected to be positive with as part of your job”—to smile and act upbeat with clients and customers—“if you can’t turn around and be real with co-workers, you are amplifying emotional labor. And you have a real problem on your hands.”\n\n\n\nEveryone wants a civil workplace, but demanding that your workers be positive may be an uncivil thing to do. It may be especially so when it comes to broad and sweeping pronouncements, as in T-Mobile’s case. [Last year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841467), a group of researchers decided to explore whether there were _any_ policies aimed at emotional management in a workplace that would actually succeed. To answer that question, they had three hundred and eighty-two employees, from a number of retail stores, rate the degree of explicitness of the rules governing their emotional behavior at work: on the one end are vague, ambiguous admonitions such as “be positive,” without any guidelines; on the other end are explicit rules that govern when you should smile, what you should say, and the like. The researchers then observed how motivated the employees were and how customers responded to them.\n\n\n\nWhat they found was an inverted-U relationship between rule explicitness and effectiveness: if rules were overly vague or overly prescriptive, they had a demotivating effect. (Customers, too, were disappointed, giving both employees and their shopping experiences lower ratings.) Where the rules generally had their intended effect was in the moderate range: when there were some explicit guidelines, but flexibility in how they were to be implemented. A second study, of a hundred and seventy-five salespeople, found the relationship to hold for sales numbers as well: sales were higher in environments with moderate rules, while environments with too few or too many rules suffered. The highest performers of all were those in a moderately regulated environment who also felt a high degree of autonomy, as determined by their responses to a single statement: “My job permits me to decide on my own how to go about doing the work.” In other words, people want to feel in control. They want to be afforded respect and to determine on their own how to act; it is this autonomy that helps foster emotional positivity. Grandey suggests we are all still a bit like our two-year-old selves: tell a toddler exactly what to do and what not to do, and she balks. Let her figure it out within a certain framework, and she is happy.\n\n\n\nSo it turns out that enforcing a generalized positivity can create problems in the realm of psychological motivation as well as in the legal realm. The issue of how to encourage workplace positivity raises another problem, which is the possibility of suppressing freedom of expression. In asking for a “positive” environment, you can promote your own agenda and reprimand anyone who doesn’t fit with your concept of positivity at that particular moment. In T-Mobile’s case, enforcing a positive environment might have been a way of preventing a very specific type of speech and action, namely anything that was critical of the employer or trying to promote employee rights. Similar dynamics have arisen in non-corporate settings. In recent years, we’ve seen a trend toward prescribing what someone can or can’t say in order to protect a subjective notion of how it makes someone else feel. This is most obviously happening on college campuses, in the guise of microaggressions, triggers, and their ilk; in some cases, the [effects of checking](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/the-new-activism-of-liberal-arts-colleges) one’s speech can be to reasonably protect members of the community, but in others the fear of offense can create anxiety and can even become a kind of censorship. T-Mobile’s positive-environment clause is, essentially, a grownup version of the “safe space” that is only safe for the people who’ve created it, not for those with contrary opinions.\n\n\n\nAnd yet the ruling itself gives us cause to be truly positive: after all, the N.L.R.B. decided against T-Mobile. One can only hope—positively, optimistically hope—that the decision presages a broader understanding of a deeper truth: we all deserve a positive environment, but that very positivity is at risk when we try to force it rather than fostering it by example.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/what-makes-people-feel-upbeat-at-work","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Psychology","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"},{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

Inspired by architectural trends of the preceding decade, the classrooms in one of its wings didn’t have doors. The rooms opened up directly onto the hallway, and tidbits about the French Revolution, say, or Benjamin Franklin’s breakfast, would drift from one classroom to another. Distracting at best and frustrating at worst, wide-open classrooms went, for the most part, the way of other ill-considered architectural fads of the time, like concrete domes. (Following an eighty-million-dollar renovation and expansion, in 2005, none of the new wings at A.B.R.H.S. have open classrooms.) Yet the workplace counterpart of the open classroom, the open office, flourishes: [some seventy per cent of all offices](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/f/21/1%2F2) now have an open floor plan.\n\n\n\nThe open office was [originally conceived](http://dwp.bigplanet.com/pdkconsulting/nss-folder/pdfdownloads1/New_DuffyTanis1993.pdf) by a team from Hamburg, Germany, in the nineteen-fifties, to facilitate communication and idea flow. But a growing body of evidence suggests that the open office undermines the very things that it was designed to achieve. In [June, 1997,](http://eab.sagepub.com/content/34/3/279) a large oil and gas company in western Canada asked a group of psychologists at the University of Calgary to monitor workers as they transitioned from a traditional office arrangement to an open one. The psychologists assessed the employees’ satisfaction with their surroundings, as well as their stress level, job performance, and interpersonal relationships before the transition, four weeks after the transition, and, finally, six months afterward. The employees suffered according to every measure: the new space was disruptive, stressful, and cumbersome, and, instead of feeling closer, coworkers felt distant, dissatisfied, and resentful. Productivity fell.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, the organizational psychologist Matthew Davis [reviewed](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119992592.ch6/summary) more than a hundred studies about office environments. He found that, though open offices often fostered [a symbolic sense of organizational mission](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/258440?uid=3739696&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103197970797), making employees feel like part of [a more laid-back, innovative enterprise](http://www.amazon.com/organization-architecture-innovation-thomas-allen/dp/0750682361), they were damaging to the workers’ attention spans, productivity, creative thinking, and satisfaction. Compared with standard offices, employees experienced more uncontrolled interactions, higher levels of stress, and lower levels of concentration and motivation. When David Craig [surveyed](http://lubswww.leeds.ac.uk/fileadmin/webfiles/cstsd/Images/PowerPoint_Presentations/Time_use_and_time_loss_-_DEGW_7Aug2010_-_FINAL.pdf) some thirty-eight thousand workers, he found that interruptions by colleagues were detrimental to productivity, and that the more senior the employee, [the worse she fared](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/255498?uid=3739696&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103198134427).\n\n\n\nPsychologically, the repercussions of open offices are relatively straightforward. Physical barriers have been closely [linked](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/255498?uid=3739696&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103198134427) to psychological privacy, and a sense of privacy [boosts job performance](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/255498?uid=3739696&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103198134427). Open offices also remove an element of control, which can lead to feelings of helplessness. In a [2005 study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494405000538) that looked at organizations ranging from a Midwest auto supplier to a Southwest telecom firm, researchers found that the ability to control the environment had a significant effect on team cohesion and satisfaction. When workers couldn’t change the way that things looked, adjust the lighting and temperature, or choose how to conduct meetings, spirits plummeted.\n\n\n\nAn open environment may even have a negative impact on our health. In a [recent study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21528171) of more than twenty-four hundred employees in Denmark, Jan Pejtersen and his colleagues found that as the number of people working in a single room went up, the number of employees who took sick leave increased apace. Workers in two-person offices took an average of fifty per cent more sick leave than those in single offices, while those who worked in fully open offices were out an average of sixty-two per cent more.\n\n\n\nBut the most problematic aspect of the open office may be physical rather than psychological: simple noise. In laboratory settings, noise [has been](http://eab.sagepub.com/content/40/2/151.abstract) repeatedly [tied](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494408000728) to reduced cognitive performance. The psychologist Nick Perham, who studies the [effect of sound](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.2826/abstract) on how we think, has found that office commotion  [impairs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412582) workers’ ability to recall information, and even to do basic arithmetic. Listening to music to block out the office intrusion doesn’t help: even that, Perham found, impairs our mental acuity. Exposure to noise in an office may also take a toll on the health of employees. [In a study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11055149) by the Cornell University psychologists Gary Evans and Dana Johnson, clerical workers who were exposed to open-office noise for three hours had increased levels of epinephrine—a hormone that we often call adrenaline, associated with the so-called fight-or-flight response. What’s more, Evans and Johnson discovered that people in noisy environments made fewer ergonomic adjustments than they would in private, causing increased physical strain. The subjects subsequently attempted to solve fewer puzzles than they had after working in a quiet environment; in other words, they became less motivated and less creative.\n\n\n\nOpen offices may seem better suited to younger workers, many of whom have been multitasking for the majority of their short careers. When, [in 2012](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17035725), Heidi Rasila and Peggie Rothe looked at how employees of a Finnish telecommunications company born after 1982 reacted to the negative effects of open-office plans, they noted that young employees found certain types of noises, such as conversations and laughter, just as distracting as their older counterparts did. The younger workers also disparaged their lack of privacy and an inability to control their environment. But they believed that the trade-offs were ultimately worth it, because the open space resulted in a sense of camaraderie; they valued the time spent socializing with coworkers, whom they often saw as friends.\n\n\n\nThat increased satisfaction, however, may merely mask the fact that younger workers also suffer in open offices. In a [2005 study](http://www.informedesign.org/Rs_detail.aspx?rsId=2366), the psychologists Alena Maher and Courtney von Hippel found that the better you are at screening out distractions, the more effectively you work in an open office. Unfortunately, [it seems that](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15583.full) the more frantically you multitask, the worse you become at blocking out distractions. Moreover, according to the Stanford University cognitive neuroscientist Anthony Wagner, heavy multitaskers are not only “more susceptible to interference from irrelevant environmental stimuli” but also worse at switching between unrelated tasks. In other words, if habitual multitaskers are interrupted by a colleague, it takes them longer to settle back into what they were doing. Regardless of age, when we’re exposed to too many inputs at once—a computer screen, music, a colleague’s conversation, the ping of an instant message—our senses become overloaded, and it requires [more work to achieve a given result](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119992592.ch6/summary).\n\n\n\nThough multitasking millennials seem to be more open to distraction as a workplace norm, the wholehearted embrace of open offices may be ingraining a cycle of underperformance in their generation: they enjoy, build, and proselytize for open offices, but may also suffer the most from them in the long run.\n\n\n\n[_Maria Konnikova_](https://twitter.com/mkonnikova) _is the author of “_[_Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes_](http://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/0670026573)_.”_","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7c2396212cbb9fc99a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Architecture","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"architecture"},{"id":"5c2e1e397e716b454591af83","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"bizpages","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bizpages"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c2710c62d10815412","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Business","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"business"},{"id":"5c2e1e394a08312cd3aa6e0e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Currency","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"currency"},{"id":"5c2e1c80ee7fe02cbd16333f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Work","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"work"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907eefe019dfc3494e9c8eb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Currency","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"currency"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

On a blustery day in early spring, sitting in a small coffee shop near the campus of New York University, where she is an adjunct professor of psychology, she was unable to load onto her laptop the Web site that we had met to discuss. This was not a technical malfunction on her end; rather, the site had been blocked. Vrangalova, who is thirty-four, with a dynamic face framed by thick-rimmed glasses, has spent the past decade researching human sexuality, and, in particular, the kinds of sexual encounters that occur outside the norms of committed relationships. The Web site she started in 2014, [casualsexproject.com](http://casualsexproject.com/), began as a small endeavor fuelled by personal referrals, but has since grown to approximately five thousand visitors a day, most of whom arrive at the site through organic Internet searches or referrals through articles and social media. To date, there have been some twenty-two hundred submissions, about evenly split between genders, each detailing the kinds of habits that, when spelled out, can occasionally alert Internet security filters. The Web site was designed to open up the discussion of one-night stands and other less-than-traditional sexual behaviors. What makes us engage in casual sex? Do we enjoy it? Does it benefit us in any way—or, perhaps, might it harm us? And who, exactly, is “us,” anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to [eighty per cent of college students report](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/02/sexual-hookup-culture.pdf) engaging in sexual acts outside committed relationships—a figure that is usually cast as the result of increasingly lax social mores, a proliferation of alcohol-fuelled parties, and a potentially violent frat culture. Critics see the high rates of casual sex as an “[epidemic](http://www.prowlmagazine.com/2015/04/college-hook-up-culture/)” of sorts that is taking over society as a whole. [Hookup culture](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/fashion/sex-on-campus-she-can-play-that-game-too.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), we hear, is [demeaning women](http://qz.com/685852/hookup-culture/) and [wreaking havoc on our ability to establish stable, fulfilling relationships](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating).\n\n\n\nThese alarms have sounded before. Writing in 1957, the author [Nora Johnson raised an eyebrow](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1957/11/sex-and-the-college-girl/305753/) at promiscuity on college campuses, noting that “sleeping around is a risky business, emotionally, physically, and morally.” Since then, the critiques of casual sexual behavior have only proliferated, even as society has ostensibly become more socially liberal. Last year, the anthropologist Peter Wood went so far as to call the rise of casual sex “[an assault on human nature](http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-meaning-of-sex/article/928461),” arguing in an article in the conservative _Weekly Standard_ that even the most meaningless-seeming sex comes with a problematic power imbalance.\n\n\n\nOthers have embraced the commonness of casual sex as a sign of social progress. In a widely read _Atlantic_ article from 2012, “[Boys on the Side](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/boys-on-the-side/309062/),” Hanna Rosin urged women to avoid serious suitors so that they could focus on their own needs and careers. And yet, despite her apparent belief in the value of casual sex as a tool of exploration and feminist thinking, Rosin, too, seemed to conclude that casual sex cannot be a meaningful end goal. “Ultimately, the desire for a deeper human connection always wins out, for both men and women,” she wrote.\n\n\n\nThe Casual Sex Project was born of Vrangalova’s frustration with this and other prevalent narratives about casual sex. “One thing that was bothering me is the lack of diversity in discussions of casual sex,” Vrangalova told me in the café. “It’s always portrayed as something college students do. And it’s almost always seen in a negative light, as something that harms women.”\n\n\n\nIt was not the first time Vrangalova had wanted to broaden a limited conversation. As an undergraduate, in Macedonia, where she studied the psychology of sexuality, she was drawn to challenge cultural taboos, writing a senior thesis on the development of lesbian and gay sexual attitudes. In the late aughts, Vrangalova started her [research on casual sex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073476) in Cornell’s developmental-psychology program. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073476) followed a group of six hundred and sixty-six freshmen over the course of a year, to see how engaging in various casual sexual activities affected markers of mental health: namely, depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, and self-esteem. [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12076/abstract) looked at more than eight hundred undergraduates to see whether individuals who engaged in casual sex felt more victimized by others, or were more socially isolated. (The results: yes to the first, no to the second.) The studies were intriguing enough that Vrangalova was offered an appointment at N.Y.U., where she remains, to further explore some of the issues surrounding the effects of nontraditional sexual behaviors on the individuals who engage in them.\n\n\n\nOver time, Vrangalova came to realize that there was a gap in her knowledge, and, indeed, in the field as a whole. Casual sex has been much explored in [psychological literature,](https://www.newyorker.com/wp-admin/%5B%5Bhttp:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3613286/%5D%5D) but most of the data captured by her research team—and most of the [other experimental research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23559846) she had encountered—had been taken from college students. (This is a common problem in psychological research: students are a convenient population for researchers.) There has been the occasional [nationally representative survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25940736), but rigorous data on other subsets of the population is sparse. Even the largest national study of sexual attitudes in the United States, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of close to six thousand men and women between the ages of fourteen and ninety-four, neglected to ask respondents how many of the encounters they engaged in could be deemed “casual.”\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nFrom its beginnings, sex research has been limited by a social stigma. The field’s pioneer, Alfred Kinsey, spent decades interviewing people about their sexual behaviors. His books sold, but he was widely criticized for not having an objective perspective: like Freud before him, he believed that repressed sexuality was at the root of much of social behavior, and he often came to judgments that supported that view—even when his conclusions were based on less-than-representative surveys. He, too, used convenient sample groups, such as prisoners, as well as volunteers, who were necessarily comfortable talking about their sexual practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fifties, William Masters and Virginia Johnson went further, inquiring openly into sexual habits and even observing people in the midst of sexual acts. Their data, too, was questioned: Could the sort of person who volunteers to have sex in a lab tell us anything about the average American? More troubling still, Masters and Johnson sought to “cure” homosexuality, revealing a bias that could easily have colored their findings.\n\n\n\nIndeed, one of the things you quickly notice when looking for data on casual sex is that, for numbers on anyone who is not a college student, you must, for the most part, look at studies conducted outside academia. When OkCupid [surveyed](https://www.okcupid.com/deep-end/the-hangover) its user base, it found that between 10.3 and 15.5 per cent of users were looking for casual sex rather than a committed relationship. In the 2014 [British Sex Survey](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/28/british-sex-survey-2014-nation-lost-sexual-swagger), conducted by the _Guardian_, approximately half of all respondents reported that they had engaged in a one-night stand (fifty-five per cent of men, and forty-three per cent of women), with homosexuals (sixty-six per cent) more likely to do so than heterosexuals (forty-eight per cent). A fifth of people said they’d slept with someone whose name they didn’t know.\n\n\n\nWith the Casual Sex Project, Vrangalova is trying to build a user base of stories that she hopes will, one day, provide the raw data for academic study. For now, she is listening: letting people come to the site, answer questions, leave replies. Ritch Savin-Williams, who taught Vrangalova at Cornell, told me that he was especially impressed by Vrangalova’s willingness “to challenge traditional concepts and research designs with objective approaches that allow individuals to give honest, thoughtful responses.”\n\n\n\nThe result is what is perhaps the largest-ever repository of information about casual-sex habits in the world—not that it has many competitors. The people who share stories range from teens to retirees (Vrangalova’s oldest participants are in their seventies), and include city dwellers and suburbanites, graduate-level-educated professionals (about a quarter of the sample) and people who never finished high school (another quarter). The majority of participants aren’t particularly religious, although a little under a third do identify as at least “somewhat” religious. Most are white, though there are also blacks, Latinos, and other racial and ethnic groups. Initially, contributions were about sixty-per-cent female, but now they’re seventy-per-cent male. (This is in line with norms; men are “supposed” to brag more about sexual exploits than women.) Anyone can submit a story, along with personal details that reflect his or her demographics, emotions, personality traits, social attitudes, and behavioral patterns, such as alcohol intake. The setup for data collection is standardized, with drop-down menus and rating scales.\n\n\n\nStill, the site is far from clinical. The home page is a colorful mosaic of squares, color-coded according to the category of sexual experience (blue: “one-night stand”; purple: “group sex”; gray: the mysterious-sounding “first of many”; and so on). Pull quotes are highlighted for each category (“Ladies if you haven’t had a hot, young Latino stud you should go get one!”). Many responses seem to boast, provoke, or exaggerate for rhetorical purposes. Reading it, I felt less a part of a research project than a member of a society devoted to titillation.\n\n\n\nVrangalova is the first to admit that the Casual Sex Project is not what you would call an objective, scientific approach to data collection. There is no random assignment, no controls, no experimental conditions; the data is not representative of the general population. The participants are self-selecting, which inevitably colors the results: if you’re taking the time to write, you are more likely to write about positive experiences. You are also more likely to have the sort of personality that comes with wanting to share details of your flings with the public. There is another problem with the Casual Sex Project that is endemic in much social-science research: absent external behavioral validation, how do we know that respondents are reporting the truth, rather than what they want us to hear or think we want them to say?\n\n\n\nAnd yet, for all these flaws, the Casual Sex Project provides a fascinating window into the sexual habits of a particular swath of the population. It may not be enough to draw new conclusions, but it can lend nuance to assumptions, expanding, for instance, ideas about who engages in casual sex or how it makes them feel. As I browsed through the entries after my meeting with Vrangalova, I came upon the words of a man who learned something new about his own sexuality during a casual encounter in his seventies: “before this I always said no one can get me of on a bj alone, I was taught better,” he writes. As a reflection of the age and demographic groups represented, the Casual Sex Project undermines the popular narrative that casual sex is the product of changing mores among the young alone. If that were the case, we would expect there to be a reluctance to engage in casual sex among the older generations, which grew up in the pre-“hookup culture” era. Such reluctance is not evident.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe reminder that people of all ages engage in casual sex might lead us to imagine three possible narratives. First, that perhaps what we see as the rise of a culture of hooking up isn’t actually new. When norms related to dating and free love shifted, in the sixties, they never fully shifted back. Seventy-year-olds are engaging in casual encounters because that attitude is part of their culture, too.\n\n\n\nThere’s another, nearly opposite explanation: casual sex isn’t the norm now, and wasn’t before. There are simply always individuals, in any generation, who seek sexual satisfaction in nontraditional confines.\n\n\n\nAnd then there’s the third option, the one that is most consistent with the narrative that our culture of casual sex begins with college hookups: that people are casually hooking up for different reasons. Some young people have casual sex because they feel they can’t afford not to, or because they are surrounded by a culture that says they should want to. (Vrangalova’s preliminary analysis of the data on her site suggests that alcohol is much more likely to be involved in the casual-sex experiences of the young than the old.)  And the old—well, the old no longer care what society thinks. For some, this sense of ease might come in their thirties; for others, their forties or fifties; for others, never, or not entirely.\n\n\n\nThis last theory relates to another of Vrangalova’s findings—one that, she confesses, came as a surprise when she first encountered it. Not all of the casual-sex experiences recorded on the site were positive, even among what is surely a heavily biased sample. Women and younger participants are especially likely to report feelings of shame. (“I was on top of him at one point and he can’t have forced me to so I must have consented . . . I’m not sure,” an eighteen-year-old writes, reporting that the hookup was unsatisfying, and describing feeling “stressed, anxious, guilt and disgust” the day after.) There is an entire thread tagged “no orgasm,” which includes other occasionally disturbing and emotional tales. “My view has gotten a lot more balanced over time,” Vrangalova said. “I come from a very sex-positive perspective, surrounded by people who really benefitted from sexual exploration and experiences, for the most part. By studying it, I’ve learned to see both sides of the coin.”\n\n\n\nPart of the negativity, to be sure, does originate in legitimate causes: casual sex increases the risk of pregnancy, disease, and, more often than in a committed relationship, physical coercion. But many negative casual-sex experiences come instead from a sense of social convention. “We’ve seen that both genders felt they were discriminated against because of sex,” Vrangalova told me. Men often feel judged by other men if they _don’t_ have casual sex, and social expectations can detract from the experiences they do have, while women feel judged for engaging in casual experiences, rendering those they pursue less pleasurable.\n\n\n\nPerhaps this should come as no surprise: the very fact that Vrangalova and others are seeking explanations for casual-sex behaviors suggests that our society views it as worthy of note—something aberrant, rather than ordinary. No one writes about why people feel the need to drink water or go to the bathroom, why eating dinner with friends is “a thing” or study groups are “on the rise.”\n\n\n\nIt is that sense of shame, ultimately, that Vrangalova hopes her project may help to address. As one respondent to a survey Vrangalova sent to users put it, “This has helped me feel okay about myself for wanting casual sex, and not feel ashamed or that what I do is wrong.” The psychologist [James Pennebaker](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/can-tweets-predict-heart-disease) has found over several decades of work that writing about emotional experiences can act as an effective form of therapy, in a way that talking about those experiences may not. (I’m less convinced that there are benefits for those who use the site as a way to boast about their own experiences.) “Often there’s no outlet for that unless you’re starting your own blog,” Vrangalova points out. “I wanted to offer a space for people to share.”\n\n\n\nThat may well end up the Casual Sex Project’s real contribution: not to tell us something we didn’t already know, or at least suspect, but to make such nonjudgmental, intimate conversations possible. The dirty little secret of casual sex today is not that we’re having it but that we’re not sharing our experiences of it in the best way.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/casual-sex-everyone-is-doing-it","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5c2e1cc422d4972cd5b832ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sex","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sex"},{"id":"5c2e1c932396212cbb9fc9b8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dating","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dating"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

On a blustery day in early spring, sitting in a small coffee shop near the campus of New York University, where she is an adjunct professor of psychology, she was unable to load onto her laptop the Web site that we had met to discuss. This was not a technical malfunction on her end; rather, the site had been blocked. Vrangalova, who is thirty-four, with a dynamic face framed by thick-rimmed glasses, has spent the past decade researching human sexuality, and, in particular, the kinds of sexual encounters that occur outside the norms of committed relationships. The Web site she started in 2014, [casualsexproject.com](http://casualsexproject.com/), began as a small endeavor fuelled by personal referrals, but has since grown to approximately five thousand visitors a day, most of whom arrive at the site through organic Internet searches or referrals through articles and social media. To date, there have been some twenty-two hundred submissions, about evenly split between genders, each detailing the kinds of habits that, when spelled out, can occasionally alert Internet security filters. The Web site was designed to open up the discussion of one-night stands and other less-than-traditional sexual behaviors. What makes us engage in casual sex? Do we enjoy it? Does it benefit us in any way—or, perhaps, might it harm us? And who, exactly, is “us,” anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to [eighty per cent of college students report](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/02/sexual-hookup-culture.pdf) engaging in sexual acts outside committed relationships—a figure that is usually cast as the result of increasingly lax social mores, a proliferation of alcohol-fuelled parties, and a potentially violent frat culture. Critics see the high rates of casual sex as an “[epidemic](http://www.prowlmagazine.com/2015/04/college-hook-up-culture/)” of sorts that is taking over society as a whole. [Hookup culture](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/fashion/sex-on-campus-she-can-play-that-game-too.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), we hear, is [demeaning women](http://qz.com/685852/hookup-culture/) and [wreaking havoc on our ability to establish stable, fulfilling relationships](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating).\n\n\n\nThese alarms have sounded before. Writing in 1957, the author [Nora Johnson raised an eyebrow](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1957/11/sex-and-the-college-girl/305753/) at promiscuity on college campuses, noting that “sleeping around is a risky business, emotionally, physically, and morally.” Since then, the critiques of casual sexual behavior have only proliferated, even as society has ostensibly become more socially liberal. Last year, the anthropologist Peter Wood went so far as to call the rise of casual sex “[an assault on human nature](http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-meaning-of-sex/article/928461),” arguing in an article in the conservative _Weekly Standard_ that even the most meaningless-seeming sex comes with a problematic power imbalance.\n\n\n\nOthers have embraced the commonness of casual sex as a sign of social progress. In a widely read _Atlantic_ article from 2012, “[Boys on the Side](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/boys-on-the-side/309062/),” Hanna Rosin urged women to avoid serious suitors so that they could focus on their own needs and careers. And yet, despite her apparent belief in the value of casual sex as a tool of exploration and feminist thinking, Rosin, too, seemed to conclude that casual sex cannot be a meaningful end goal. “Ultimately, the desire for a deeper human connection always wins out, for both men and women,” she wrote.\n\n\n\nThe Casual Sex Project was born of Vrangalova’s frustration with this and other prevalent narratives about casual sex. “One thing that was bothering me is the lack of diversity in discussions of casual sex,” Vrangalova told me in the café. “It’s always portrayed as something college students do. And it’s almost always seen in a negative light, as something that harms women.”\n\n\n\nIt was not the first time Vrangalova had wanted to broaden a limited conversation. As an undergraduate, in Macedonia, where she studied the psychology of sexuality, she was drawn to challenge cultural taboos, writing a senior thesis on the development of lesbian and gay sexual attitudes. In the late aughts, Vrangalova started her [research on casual sex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073476) in Cornell’s developmental-psychology program. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073476) followed a group of six hundred and sixty-six freshmen over the course of a year, to see how engaging in various casual sexual activities affected markers of mental health: namely, depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, and self-esteem. [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12076/abstract) looked at more than eight hundred undergraduates to see whether individuals who engaged in casual sex felt more victimized by others, or were more socially isolated. (The results: yes to the first, no to the second.) The studies were intriguing enough that Vrangalova was offered an appointment at N.Y.U., where she remains, to further explore some of the issues surrounding the effects of nontraditional sexual behaviors on the individuals who engage in them.\n\n\n\nOver time, Vrangalova came to realize that there was a gap in her knowledge, and, indeed, in the field as a whole. Casual sex has been much explored in [psychological literature,](https://www.newyorker.com/wp-admin/%5B%5Bhttp:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3613286/%5D%5D) but most of the data captured by her research team—and most of the [other experimental research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23559846) she had encountered—had been taken from college students. (This is a common problem in psychological research: students are a convenient population for researchers.) There has been the occasional [nationally representative survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25940736), but rigorous data on other subsets of the population is sparse. Even the largest national study of sexual attitudes in the United States, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of close to six thousand men and women between the ages of fourteen and ninety-four, neglected to ask respondents how many of the encounters they engaged in could be deemed “casual.”\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nFrom its beginnings, sex research has been limited by a social stigma. The field’s pioneer, Alfred Kinsey, spent decades interviewing people about their sexual behaviors. His books sold, but he was widely criticized for not having an objective perspective: like Freud before him, he believed that repressed sexuality was at the root of much of social behavior, and he often came to judgments that supported that view—even when his conclusions were based on less-than-representative surveys. He, too, used convenient sample groups, such as prisoners, as well as volunteers, who were necessarily comfortable talking about their sexual practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fifties, William Masters and Virginia Johnson went further, inquiring openly into sexual habits and even observing people in the midst of sexual acts. Their data, too, was questioned: Could the sort of person who volunteers to have sex in a lab tell us anything about the average American? More troubling still, Masters and Johnson sought to “cure” homosexuality, revealing a bias that could easily have colored their findings.\n\n\n\nIndeed, one of the things you quickly notice when looking for data on casual sex is that, for numbers on anyone who is not a college student, you must, for the most part, look at studies conducted outside academia. When OkCupid [surveyed](https://www.okcupid.com/deep-end/the-hangover) its user base, it found that between 10.3 and 15.5 per cent of users were looking for casual sex rather than a committed relationship. In the 2014 [British Sex Survey](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/28/british-sex-survey-2014-nation-lost-sexual-swagger), conducted by the _Guardian_, approximately half of all respondents reported that they had engaged in a one-night stand (fifty-five per cent of men, and forty-three per cent of women), with homosexuals (sixty-six per cent) more likely to do so than heterosexuals (forty-eight per cent). A fifth of people said they’d slept with someone whose name they didn’t know.\n\n\n\nWith the Casual Sex Project, Vrangalova is trying to build a user base of stories that she hopes will, one day, provide the raw data for academic study. For now, she is listening: letting people come to the site, answer questions, leave replies. Ritch Savin-Williams, who taught Vrangalova at Cornell, told me that he was especially impressed by Vrangalova’s willingness “to challenge traditional concepts and research designs with objective approaches that allow individuals to give honest, thoughtful responses.”\n\n\n\nThe result is what is perhaps the largest-ever repository of information about casual-sex habits in the world—not that it has many competitors. The people who share stories range from teens to retirees (Vrangalova’s oldest participants are in their seventies), and include city dwellers and suburbanites, graduate-level-educated professionals (about a quarter of the sample) and people who never finished high school (another quarter).

The dirty little secret of casual sex today is not that we’re having it but that we’re not sharing our experiences of it in the best way.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/casual-sex-everyone-is-doing-it","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Psychology","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5c2e1cc422d4972cd5b832ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cc422d4972cd5b832ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sex","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sex"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Sex","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"sex"},{"id":"5c2e1c932396212cbb9fc9b8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c932396212cbb9fc9b8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dating","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dating"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Dating","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"dating"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"},{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

From time to time, their caretakers give them tokens, which they can then exchange for food. It’s a truth universally acknowledged that capuchin monkeys prefer grapes to cucumbers. So what happens when unfairness strikes—when, in exchange for identical tokens, one monkey gets a cucumber and the other a grape?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal [carried out](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6955/full/nature01963.html) just this experiment, in 2003, focussing on female capuchin monkeys, they found that monkeys hate being disadvantaged. A monkey in isolation is happy to eat either a grape or a slice of cucumber. But a monkey who sees that she’s received a cucumber while her partner has gotten a grape reacts with anger: she might hurl her cucumber from her cage. Some primates, Brosnan and de Waal concluded, “dislike inequity.” They hate getting the short end of the stick. Psychologists have a technical term for this reaction: they call it “disadvantageous-inequity aversion.” This instinctual aversion to getting less than others has been found in [chimpanzees](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210000631) and [dogs](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/1/340), and it occurs, of course, in people, in whom it seems to develop from a young age. The psychologists Alessandra Geraci and Luca Surian have [found](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01048.x/abstract), for example, that babies as young as twelve months prefer fair-minded cartoon animals to unfair ones.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, for humans, an aversion to getting less is just one aspect of unfairness. Unlike other animals, we sometimes balk at receiving _more_ than other people. Technically speaking, we experience “advantageous-inequity aversion.” In some situations, we’ll even give up something good because it’s more than someone else is getting. In those moments, we seek to insure that the distribution of goods remains fair. We don’t want the long end of the stick, either.\n\n\n\nIt seems likely that our aversion to being disadvantaged is innate, because we share it with other animals. The question for psychologists is whether our aversion to _benefitting_ from inequality is innate, too—or, alternatively, if it’s learned through some form of socialization. In December, the psychologists Peter Blake, Katherine McAuliffe, Felix Warneken, and their colleagues [published](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature15703.html) the results of experiments designed to answer this question. Their research spanned seven nations—India, Uganda, Peru, Senegal, Mexico, Canada, and the United States—and looked at close to nine hundred children, aged four to fifteen. They examined whether advantageous-inequity aversion—A.I., as they call it—emerges in all cultures, and, if it does, whether it emerges in the same way everywhere.\n\n\n\nTheir method was relatively simple. They sat two children down at a table, each in front of an empty bowl. Above each bowl was a tray, onto which the experimenter placed candy. Often, she distributed candy unfairly: she might place four candies on one tray and only one on the other. The child being tested then faced a choice. She could pull a green handle to accept the presented candies, causing them to fall into their respective bowls—or she could pull a red handle to reject them, causing all the candies to fall into a third, off-limits bowl, in the center.\n\n\n\nThe researchers found that, all over the world, children tended to reject the candies when the split favored the other child. (That is, they rejected disadvantageous inequity, or D.I.) They also found that some, older kids would reject _advantageous_ offers. None of that is surprising. A.I. has been documented among adults many times in the past; in [one early study](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/keith.chen/negot.%20papers/LoewThompBazer_SocUtilDecMake89.pdf), from behavioral economist George Loewenstein and his colleagues, as many as sixty-six per cent of participants disliked getting more than someone else. The surprising part is that the kids only displayed A.I. in three countries: Canada, the United States, and Uganda. In the other countries—Mexico, India, Senegal, and Peru—they enjoyed the sweet taste of inequality.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThese results raise some fascinating questions. Why were kids from only certain countries bothered by having an unfair advantage? And were they rejecting those unfair offers because they cared about fairness—or for some other, less obvious reason?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s helpful to start by stepping back from the more complicated case of A.I. to the simpler case of D.I. There are lots of reasons to object to disadvantageous inequity, and some are more obvious than others. D.I. is bad substantively, of course, because you get less candy. But it’s also bad socially, because it signals a demotion in status. In fact, when kids reject disadvantageous offers, they’re often most concerned about their social status, rather than with the candy itself, or with abstract ideas like equality. It’s not about right or wrong. It’s all about _me_: how do I come off in this scenario?\n\n\n\nThe importance of social hierarchy in the rejection of disadvantageous unfairness has been cleverly demonstrated in several experiments. In [one study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027713002102), the psychologists Mark Sheskin, Paul Bloom, and Karen Wynn had kids choose between getting one token and giving one to another child, or getting two tokens and giving three to the other kid. “You might think that the latter is the better choice because both children get more,” Bloom writes, in his book “Just Babies.” Often, though, the children chose the first option—just one token each—insuring that they wouldn’t get less than someone else.\n\n\n\nIn another version of the study, Bloom and his colleagues offered a choice between two tokens all around, or one for the subject and _none_ for her counterpart. Five- and six-year-olds preferred the second option: that is, they gave up a reward in exchange for having more than their peers. “We have a natural aversion to getting less—not to inequity,” Bloom told me. The kids’ behavior isn’t principled; on the contrary, Bloom believes, it seems motivated by something very much like spite. And the message is clear: I want to emerge on top. The absolute number of candies matters less than my relative status.\n\n\n\nIf D.I. is really about status rather than fairness, could A.I. be about status, too? Rejecting an _advantageous_ offer, after all, also sends a social signal. If you live in a society where ideas of fairness and equality hold a privileged position, then it becomes meaningful to show yourself as embracing those ideals, even at personal cost. Those around you might feel that, since you’re the type of person who believes in equity no matter what, you’re valuable to society, and worthy of respect. From this perspective, both D.I. and A.I. achieve the same end: making sure you maintain status. Perhaps, for older kids who are transitioning into adolescence, status doesn’t always come from having more. It could also flow from being an admirable role model.\n\n\n\nIf status really is the driving force behind both D.I. and A.I., it would explain one of the study’s relative outliers: Mexico. When the experiment was run there, very few of the children exhibited A.I.; moreover, D.I. appeared to develop far later than in other societies. The Mexican children, in other words, tended to accept all offers, however unequal in any direction. The authors point out that, in that particular sample, most of the kids already knew each other. Perhaps they had already developed reputations, and, as a result, what happened in the experiment had no real implications for their social hierarchy. They were free to enjoy the candy all by itself, without social signals on the side.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nStill, even if A.I. and D.I. have a lot in common—even if they’re both about status—the research from Blake and his colleagues suggests that they are different in at least one fundamental way. D.I. is innate: all over the world, and in the animal kingdom, getting less than others is perceived as an insult. A.I., on the other hand, seems to be a product of social life or culture. Globally, at least among children, it appears to be very unevenly distributed. In Canada, the United States, and Uganda, the study shows that older kids are _more_ likely, on average, to reject an advantageous offer than an equal offer. By contrast, in Mexico, Peru, India, and Senegal, they willingly accept getting more. In the past, studies of A.I. have focussed on so-called *WEIRD*{: .small} societies—Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. As a result, the uneven distribution of A.I. went beneath the radar.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explain its uneven distribution, Blake and his colleagues point to a number of potential causes. The most prominent is “Western norms.” They suggest that advantageous-equity aversion is more prevalent in Western societies because, in the West, equality and the abstract notion of “fairness” are valued as goods in their own right; it’s only within that framework that sacrificing your self-interest in the name of fairness comes to be linked with status. (In recent years, of course, Western societies have been wrestling with the problem of rising inequality—an irony on which the researchers choose not to dwell.) In an [earlier study](http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0080966&representation=PDF), McAuliffe, Blake, Warneken, and their colleagues found that, while subjects exhibited D.I. even in the absence of a visible partner, A.I. only emerged in social situations. This suggests that A.I. might require certain kinds of social environments to thrive.\n\n\n\nIf it’s Western culture that encourages A.I., then why is it so common in Uganda? Blake and his colleagues posit that the answer lies in the specific subset of the Ugandan population they surveyed. They recruited children from schools that had Western teachers, and in which students were frequently exposed to Western researchers. Perhaps, they write, that environment had changed the students’ sense of fairness. This reasoning seems a bit thin: aren’t other societies also exposed to Western norms, especially in the modern age of ubiquitous smartphones and mass media? “It remains possible that children in Uganda reject an advantage for other reasons not linked to Western norms,” the authors write. “If this is the case, we would expect to see A.I. emerge in children in other communities in Uganda with similar cultural norms but different institutional structures.”\n\n\n\nBehind the question of how “Western” A.I. is, a broader question looms. What factors in society could create a norm whereby it’s valuable to establish yourself publicly as someone who doesn’t want to receive more than others? In the same set of studies in which he found that, under some circumstances, up to sixty-six per cent of adults experienced A.I., George Loewenstein tried to tease out what conditions might give rise to advantageous-inequality aversion in the first place. He started by asking subjects to imagine themselves in a specific business scenario. In the first scenario, they had invented a new type of ski with someone; in another, they were splitting tax revenue from a vacant lot with a neighbor; and, in a third, they were in conflict with a sales manager at a retail outlet. In each of these scenarios, their preëxisting relationship with their counterpart was described as positive, negative, or neutral, and the financial payments were either equal or representative of disadvantageous or advantageous inequity. As expected, when it came to D.I., pretty much no one enjoyed receiving less than the co-inventor, business partner, or manager. A.I., by contrast, was unevenly distributed; in some situations, it was absent altogether. It emerged readily in the invention and vacant-lot scenarios—_if_ the preëxisting relationship was positive or neutral; it was relatively infrequent in the retail scenario; and, if the relationship was negative, it disappeared across the board. (In that case, people preferred to come out ahead of their counterparts.)\n\n\n\nBased on his participants’ choices, Loewenstein divided them into three groups: saints, loyalists, and ruthless competitors. Saints preferred equality over everything else; they were concerned with fairness for its own sake. Loyalists preferred equality in positive relationships, but, in negative ones, they sought A.I.—they approached the relationship socially, seeking to create loyalty by giving up their unfair advantages. Ruthless competitors always preferred getting more. The relative percentages of the saints, loyalists, and ruthless competitors were twenty-four, twenty-seven, and thirty-six, respectively. (Eighteen per cent couldn’t be classified.) Then, in a follow-up, Loewenstein clarified the preëxisting relationships, providing his subjects with several paragraphs of explanation as to why those relationships were positive, negative, or neutral. Under that condition, the number of saints and ruthless competitors fell, while the proportion of loyalists rose to over half—fifty-two per cent.\n\n\n\nWhen participants received more context for the study’s social scenarios and became more invested in their relationships, in other words, they gave up more to nourish and maintain them. And they are wise to do so. The [results](http://fowler.ucsd.edu/egalitarian_motives.pdf) of another set of experiments show that the more someone earns in a context of inequality, the more hostile reactions from others she provokes. People dislike those at the top of the heap more when the heap itself is taller.\n\n\n\nAll of these findings have something to say about why we value fairness. Our ideas about fairness are relativistic, rather than absolute. In many ways, we approach fairness as a form of social signalling. People tend not to care about equality as an abstract principle; instead, they use fairness to negotiate their place in a social hierarchy. And, for that reason, we’re especially willing to give up our unfair advantages when there’s the possibility of strengthening a future relationship.\n\n\n\nCould these general principles explain why A.I. appears earlier or more often in some societies? Possibly, but there’s a lot more research to do before anything like a clear-cut answer emerges. One thing we do know is that culture plays a role—but what kind of culture? Can it be taught? Maybe, if we can figure out the answer to that question, we’ll be able to build a world where there are more saints and loyalists—and fewer ruthless competitors.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-we-learn-fairness","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e2c63b75f002c8941e8b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fairness","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fairness"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f16198449f3364193dfc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Maria Konnikova","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"maria-konnikova"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a06018b51cf59fc424726","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Maria Konnikova is the author of the _Times_ best-seller “[Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Think-Like-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/014312434X),” which was nominated for an Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction, and “[The Confidence Game](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Game-Fall-Every-Time/dp/0143109871),” about the psychology of the con.

There he develops a compound called 3-blindmycin, which has the power to turn people on: “not raise the libido,” Comfort later told a journalist, “but thaw the superego, the part of the mind that says ‘mustn’t.’ ” In a climactic scene, an explosion releases a cloud of 3-blindmycin over Buckingham Palace, leaving throngs of uninhibited Englishmen in its wake. Years afterward, Comfort said he’d always hoped that Peter Sellers would play him if the book were made into a film; for his leading lady, he pictured Sophia Loren.\n\n\n\n\n\nHollywood seems not to have been interested in the story. But if someone were to make a bio-pic of Comfort’s own life it might well feature a scene intercutting that aphrodisiacal cloud with images from Comfort’s most famous book, the 1972 best-seller “The Joy of Sex.” That, too, was a kind of explosion, intended to unleash its readers’ sexual potential by counteracting their ignorance and shame. “The Joy of Sex,” which has sold more than twelve million copies worldwide, was an “unanxious account of the full repertoire of human heterosexuality,” according to its author. It was the English answer to Japanese pillow books, illustrated texts designed to show couples where to put what, and was further enhanced by helpful advice: for instance, “Never, never refer to pillow-talk in anger later on (‘I always knew you were a lesbian,’ etc.).”\n\n\n\nWith its discreet cover and its content divided into Starters, Main Courses, and Sauces & Pickles, the book was loosely modelled on “Joy of Cooking,” the culinary how-to book that had transformed the way its readers thought about food. Comfort wanted to do the same thing with making love—help people gain a sense of proficiency with the subject matter, and ultimately render them capable of “Cordon Bleu sex.” But people had never been ashamed to cook. “The Joy of Sex” was something new. Unbridled eroticism “could well be the major contribution of the Aquarian revolution to human happiness,” Comfort wrote. He cautioned that people who failed to come to terms with an aggressive sexuality were “apt to end up at My Lai or Belsen.”\n\n\n\nComfort’s fellow-Britons were already familiar with his immoderate style of self-expression and his utopian thinking when “The Joy of Sex” appeared. Comfort often aired his “anarcho-pacifist” views on the BBC, and he had published several political polemics, in addition to his novels, books of poetry, and what was at the time the preëminent textbook on gerontology. Comfort was brilliant and multitalented, but there was a certain pat, self-satisfied idealism to much of his nonscientific work. In 1941, George Orwell wrote an eviscerating review of Comfort’s novel “No Such Liberty,” deploring “the argument which is implied all the way through, and sometimes explicitly stated, that there is next to no difference between Britain and Germany, political persecution is as bad in one as in the other, those who fight against the Nazis always go Nazi themselves.” Orwell noted, “If I treat Mr. Comfort’s novel as a tract, I am only doing what he himself has done already.” \n\n\n\nComfort had a tendency to focus single-mindedly on a given notion or project at the expense of any kind of balance: while he was a student at Highgate School, in London, he became convinced that he could concoct a superior version of gunpowder. He blew off much of his left hand. By the time he was finished with his experiments, his thumb was the only remaining digit. Later in his life, when he was practicing medicine, he said that he found this claw he’d created “very useful for performing uterine inversions.” After he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, his enthusiasms led him to accumulate six degrees, including a doctorate in biochemistry.\n\n\n\nComfort turned his attention to sexual liberation with a similar zeal. He offered readers a creation myth for “The Joy of Sex” on the first page, claiming that the book was based on a manuscript that an anonymous and particularly sexually advanced couple had presented to him in his capacity as a biologist. “I have done little to the original draft apart from expansion to cover more topics,” Comfort wrote. “The authors’ choice of emphases and their light-hearted style have been left alone.” In fact, both the choice of emphases and the lighthearted style were Comfort’s; he wrote every word of “The Joy of Sex,” though his credit on the book says “edited by.” Comfort later claimed that he had made up this randy authorial couple because in England at the time it was frowned upon for physicians to write mass-market books, “an implementation of the principle that doctors don’t advertise—of which I thoroughly approve, by the way,” he remarked to a journalist in 1974. But it was also probably a subterfuge, to protect the feelings of his wife of thirty years, Ruth Harris. For more than a decade, Comfort had been sleeping with Ruth’s best friend, Jane Henderson. (Comfort met both women at Cambridge.) Comfort and Henderson took dozens of Polaroids of their erotic experiments, which they gave to the publisher Mitchell Beazley along with Comfort’s manuscript—originally titled “Doing Sex Properly.” The artists Charles Raymond and Christopher Foss were charged with transforming those photographs into pencil drawings, although the couple they depicted looked nothing like Comfort and Henderson. \n\n\n\nIf you are a child of the seventies and were raised on “The Joy of Sex,” you are not likely to have forgotten the illustrations. The woman depicted in these drawings is lovely, and, even nearly forty years later, quite chic. Her gentleman friend, however, looks like a werewolf with a hangover. He is heavily bearded; his hair is long, and, it always seemed, a little greasy. His eyelids are usually at half-mast, adding to his feral appearance. In some of the pictures, you can practically smell him. (The smell is unpleasant.)\n\n\n\nIt isn’t easy watching beauty get pawed by the beast, and our narrator does not help matters. “At a certain level and for all men,” Comfort informs us, “girls, and parts of girls, are at this stimulus level unpeople.” In “The Joy of Sex,” a male is a man, a female is a girl, and a vagina is, to “males generally, slightly scarey: it looks like a castrating wound and bleeds regularly, it swallows the penis and regurgitates it limp, it can probably bite and so on.” Men can get past such fears, of what Freudians called the vagina dentata, but Comfort cautions that “they are the origins of most male hangups including homosexuality.” The penis, by contrast, “has more symbolic importance than any other human organ.” Lest there be any confusion: “Vibrators are no substitute for a penis.” Comfort even enlists his fictional female narrator to argue the point for him. Under the heading “Women (by her for him),” Comfort writes of male genitalia, “It’s less the size than the personality, unpredictable movements, and moods which make up the turn-on (which is why rubber dummies are so sickening).” At times, “The Joy of Sex” has the feel of a penis propaganda pamphlet.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThere was not a lot of feminist outcry about the book when it was published, probably because in 1972 there was so much else for feminists to cry about. There was, however, a feminist alternative: the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective’s “Our Bodies, Ourselves.” The book announced on its original, 1971 jacket that it was “By and for Women,” and with its democratic inclusion of numerous voices it had the vibe of a consciousness-raising group. (In fact, it was the product of one.) “Our Bodies, Ourselves” covered much of the same material as “The Joy of Sex,” just with a different tone. It, too, had illustrations of a hirsute couple having intercourse in a series of positions. Both books said that everybody was bisexual, that sex should be a mutually satisfying, full-body experience, and that the communication of turn-ons could be of great benefit to this enterprise. And both books espoused the (distinctly seventies) notion that sex could be a value-neutral experience, as natural as eating, which undermined the traditional belief that sex ought to be in the service of procreation within the bounds of matrimony. “Our Bodies, Ourselves” added information on health, nutrition, self-defense, childbearing, and a rather more involved section on lesbianism. (“The Joy of Sex” has a drawing of two naked ladies kissing under the heading “Bisexuality,” while “Our Bodies, Ourselves” includes a chapter entitled “In Amerika They Call Us Dykes.”) If “The Joy of Sex” was like “Joy of Cooking”—though in some ways it was closer to Julia Child’s “Mastering the Art of French Cooking,” what with its strong authorial voice and affection for elaborate undertakings, to which Comfort assigned French names like _pattes d’araignée, cuissade_, and _feuille de rose_—“Our Bodies, Ourselves” was like the “Moosewood Cookbook.” Everything in it was healthful, enlightened, nourishing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a trick you might try at home sometime: pick almost any recipe in the “Moosewood.” Now add bacon. You will find that the addition of this decidedly unwholesome ingredient makes the food taste much better. “Our Bodies, Ourselves,” likewise, lacked a certain trayf allure. The revised edition of the book—even the original—is a fantastic resource for educating young women (and very sophisticated girls) about their physicality. But as an erotic reference for adults in 2008 it’s a little vegan.\n\n\n\nOf course, there are endless alternatives now. If you are young and sassy, for example, you might enjoy “Sex: How to Do Everything,” by two women who call themselves Em & Lo and have a penchant for frisky wordplay. A character in John Updike’s “The Witches of Eastwick” thinks that “marriage is like two people locked up with one lesson to read, over and over, until the words become madness.” If this rings true to you, you might be interested in “The Best-Ever Sex Handbook: Successful Techniques and New Ideas for Long-Term Lovers.” If you are Wiccan, there’s “Wicked Voodoo Sex,” in which the author, Kathleen Charlotte, promises to help you reclaim your “wanga.”\n\n\n\nBut none of those books have been huge best-sellers or cultural touchstones in the way that “The Joy of Sex” and “Our Bodies, Ourselves” were. Partly, this is because “Joy” and “Our Bodies” were a part of a movement that radically reformed the way the English-speaking world conceives of sexuality. At this point, only on Opposite Day is sex under-publicized in America. And there is also the matter of the World Wide Web. As the puppets in the Broadway musical “Avenue Q” sing, “The Internet is for porn.” Of course, the Internet is for everything, but it’s particularly good for quick answers: When was the Ming period? How do you prepare a truly fluffy frittata? And what is “The Flying Camel”?\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nInto the mobbed marketplace of how-to books and limitless Googling, Crown is releasing a new edition of “The Joy of Sex” ($29.95). Comfort himself revised his book several times; now Susan Quilliam, a British “relationship psychologist and agony aunt” (as her Web site describes her), has endeavored to modernize the text for a new, post-feminist era. Gone are some of the most outrageous Comfortisms, such as “Don’t get yourself raped,” or his dubious assessment of the rhythm method—“It may well account for the slightly higher incidence of abnormal babies among Catholic users through stale eggs getting fertilized.” Deodorant is no longer “banned absolutely,” as it was by Comfort, and armpit shaving is not referred to as “ignorant vandalism.” Finally, and crucially, rear-entry intercourse is no longer called sex “à la Négresse.”\n\n\n\n\n\nQuilliam has succeeded in bringing “The Joy of Sex” up to current standards. Instead of opening with a crack about “one-legged ladies,” as Comfort did, Quilliam adds a well-written section on special considerations for disabled readers, which is sensitive without being condescending. The book is still emphatically straight, but Quilliam has given it a gay-positive tone, in sharp contrast to Comfort’s advice that if you might be that way inclined it was better not to experiment too much with a partner of the same sex, lest you let the gay genie out of the bottle. The original drawings have been replaced, with a mixture of modest photographs and impressionistic sketches. The hairiness has been eliminated, and the attractiveness gap between the man and the woman has been bridged. But the people in these pictures do not look as if they were in any kind of sexual ecstasy. Rather, they have the smug smiles of a couple whose 401(k)s have just appreciated. They look as if they were in a Viagra commercial, which is to say that they look like two people who have never, ever had sex.\n\n\n\nOnce you remove those memorable drawings and Comfort’s batty, phallocentric prose, what you are left with is something that bears little resemblance to the subversive, explosive original. “The Joy of Sex” redux becomes generic—_Cook’s Illustrated_ with boobies. What was revolutionary in 1972 seems obvious now, and to present the material otherwise feels silly and square. It is difficult, for example, to take seriously the claim made by the new “Joy” that anal sex is “one of the last taboos,” when it was listed as fair game in Comfort’s text nearly forty years ago—and appears in both the Kamasutra (of the third century) and the Chinese “Rou Pu Tuan,” from the Ming period (1368-1644; I Googled it). Quilliam hews to Comfort’s basic premise that too much weirdness in sex is just as bad as too little, and the new edition retains Comfort’s assertion that “exclusive obsessions in sex are very like living exclusively on horseradish sauce through allergy to beef; fear of horseradish sauce, however, as indigestible, unnecessary, and immature, is another hangup, namely puritanism.” But, if procreation is no longer the goal of sex, why is one erotic practice more nutritious than the next? Who gets to decide what is horseradish and what is beef?\n\n\n\nOne is reminded of a line in Comfort’s poem “Notes for My Son,” in which he says, “Remember when you hear them beginning to say Freedom / Look carefully—see who it is.” Comfort’s freethinking did not extend beyond the boundaries of his own inclinations, and he said as much in his text. “We have tried to stay wide open, but it is always difficult to write about things one doesn’t enjoy, and we have left out long discussion of the very specialized sexual attitudes . . . which aren’t really love or even sex in quite our sense of the word.”\n\n\n\nComfort and his wife, Ruth, divorced shortly after “Joy” came out: the unpleasantness of his infidelity seems to have been heightened for Mrs. Comfort when her husband became internationally known as “Dr. Sex.” In 1973, a few months later, Comfort married his mistress and muse, Jane, and the two moved to Santa Barbara so that Comfort could assume a post at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a liberal think tank. The move also gave them closer proximity to the Sandstone, a clothing-optional community of utopian swingers in Topanga Canyon, which was reportedly visited by Timothy Leary, Sammy Davis, Jr., Betty Dodson, and the porn star Marilyn Chambers, and which Comfort and Jane had frequented since 1970. “Often the nude biologist Dr. Alex Comfort, brandishing a cigar, traipsed through the room between the prone bodies with the professional air of a lepidopterist strolling through the fields waving a butterfly net,” Gay Talese wrote in “Thy Neighbor’s Wife.”\n\n\n\nBut Jane, according to a friend who was interviewed by the journalist Pagan Kennedy, eventually tired of group sex and open marriage. (Sexual fads may come and go, but jealousy is forever.) At the same time, Comfort’s relationship with the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions soured, and he became involved in lawsuits with the center over breach of contract. In 1985, Comfort and Henderson returned to England, where he lived the rest of his life, more or less monogamously, in Kent.\n\n\n\nComfort suffered a massive brain hemorrhage in 1991, at the age of seventy-one, and Jane died shortly thereafter. From then until Comfort’s death, in 2000, his son from his first marriage, Nicholas, was Comfort’s caretaker and took over the business of managing “The Joy of Sex.” “He was good about talking about sex in the abstract, but when he had to tell me about the facts of life he was embarrassed,” Nicholas Comfort told a reporter on the occasion of the book’s thirtieth anniversary. “He got it all over with quite quickly and hoped I wouldn’t ask any questions.” ♦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/05/doing-it","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ce041c92e2c9b85daab","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Adultery","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"adultery"},{"id":"5c2e1fc881ab3335f580f403","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alex","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alex"},{"id":"5c2e1da636cecf4019214327","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Best-Sellers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"best-sellers"},{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1cb7397f5b30646d063e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Charles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"charles"},{"id":"5c2e1d69397f5b30646d06fa","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Christopher","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"christopher"},{"id":"5c2e1ce2b75f002c8941e506","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"George","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"george"},{"id":"5c2e1fe82bc86f2c9a244c8e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Harris","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"harris"},{"id":"5c2e1fe6aef5062c9d94abca","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Henderson","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"henderson"},{"id":"5c2e1f33425c632c6cd707a2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jane","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jane"},{"id":"5c2e1deb2396212cbb9fcaeb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mitchell","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mitchell"},{"id":"5c2e1cb9397f5b30646d0641","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nicholas","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nicholas"},{"id":"5c2e32ee81ab3335f580f632","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Orwell","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"orwell"},{"id":"5c2e216d4a08312cd3aa6f98","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Physicians","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"physicians"},{"id":"5c2e1e242bc86f2c9a244b94","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Raymond","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"raymond"},{"id":"5c2e1f25397f5b30646d085e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ruth","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ruth"},{"id":"5c2e1cc422d4972cd5b832ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sex","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sex"},{"id":"5c2e1cb741e4c73c088d77cf","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Susan","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"susan"}],"sections":[{"id":"592e2a5036e1a35e5cba5262","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b3dd6207318b5db991","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Ariel Levy joined _The New Yorker_ as a staff writer in 2008.

Rubio implied that Trump’s Presidential campaign was another instance of intentional deception. It’s a message we’ve heard not just from Rubio, but from Ted Cruz and Mitt Romney, as well as various pundits. I heard it with special interest: my book “The Confidence Game,” about [con artists and the psychology of the con](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-stories-deceive), was published earlier this year. Suppose that Trump is a con artist—what, exactly, would that mean?\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliticians often call one another liars. By calling Trump a con artist, Rubio may have just meant to say that Trump was a grandiose liar—someone who has lied above and beyond the typical level permissible in politics. Many politicians—indeed, many people—are deceitful, and many businesspeople run companies that go bankrupt or which sell products that aren’t particularly good. Still, these people are not necessarily con artists. In writing “The Confidence Game,” I learned that a con artist, or “confidence man,” is a very specific type of person.\n\n\n\nA line, thin but perceptible, divides even egregious liars from confidence men. People deceive one another for all sorts of reasons: they might lie to stay out of trouble, for example, or to make themselves seem more interesting, or to urge a business deal toward its consummation. David Maurer, a linguist turned historian of the con, said, “If confidence men operate outside the law, it must be remembered that they are not much further outside than many of our pillars of society who go under names less sinister.” Still, there is a meaningful difference between an ordinary liar and a con artist. A grifter takes advantage of a person's confidence for his own specific ends—ends that are often unknowable to the victim and unrelated to the business at hand. He willfully deceives a mark into handing over his trust under false pretenses. He has a plan. What ultimately sets con artists apart is their intent. To figure out if someone is a con artist, one needs to ask two questions. First, is their deception knowing, malicious, and directed, ultimately, toward their own personal gain? Second, is the con a means to an end unrelated to the substance of the scheme itself?\n\n\n\nFor a con artist, no matter the chosen racket—Ponzi schemes, à la Madoff; feats of imposturing, as from “Catch Me If You Can”; romance scams; psychic scams; old-fashioned street grift—the end goal is the same: personal profit. But the profit need not be financial. Often, it isn’t. Underlying almost any con is the desire for power—for control over other people’s lives. That power can take the form of reputation, adulation, or the thrill of knowing oneself to be the orchestrator of others’ fates—of being a sort of mini-god. The path to that end is entirely secondary. Ferdinand Waldo Demara, one of the greatest con men in history, was known as the Great Imposter. He never finished high school but impersonated everyone from a professor to a surgeon to a prison warden. Demara was often penniless, despite his scams—but he found ways to enjoy the admiration of multitudes and to exert power over the lives of others (very concretely, in the case of surgery). The racket itself mattered less than those ultimate goals.\n\n\n\nIf Trump were a con artist, he would be interested in politics only as a means to some other end. He wouldn’t believe in his political opinions; instead, he would see those opinions as convenient tools for gaining what he actually desires. Insofar as he believed in any of the policies he espoused, that belief would be purely incidental. Con artists aren’t true believers; they are opportunists. Trump, as a con artist, would give up on politics the moment it stopped serving his purposes, moving on to the next thing that gave him the same level of attention and adulation. He might, for example, drift away from political life the same way he drifted away from “The Apprentice,” or from any of his business or real-estate ventures before that.\n\n\n\nWe already see some evidence of that drift in the evolution, such as it is, of his political views. Take, for example, immigration. One of the few points that he’s raised during his campaign is a promise to build a “beautiful” wall between the United States and Mexico. And yet, back in the nineteen-eighties, Trump was charged with employing illegal immigrants in the demolition of the Bonwit Teller building and the construction of Trump Tower. That disconnect seems more in keeping with an opportunistic mindset than one that is truly anti-immigrant.\n\n\n\nAnother thing that differentiates con artists from ordinary liars is their nuanced and targeted use of flattery. Confidence men know that the best way to achieve their desires is to tell people what they want to hear rather than what is true. The quickest way to gain a mark’s trust is to sell him a vision of the world as he wants, or believes, it to be. Consider the 2013 case of [Paul Frampton](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2968276/He-went-straight-neck-decapitated-Professor-fell-honeytrap-cocaine-sting-relives-horrifying-moment-prisoner-butchered-eyes-notorious-Argentinian-jail.html), a former physics professor who fell for a sweetheart scam of the highest order: he found himself in a South American jail for drug smuggling rather than married to a supermodel. The woman who posed as the model—she impersonated a real model, Denise Milani—played to Frampton’s vanity, convincing him that a divorced, sixty-eight-year-old particle physicist was the ideal match for a thirty-two-year-old former Miss Bikini World. It didn’t make rational sense, and yet Frampton was willing to believe that every supermodel should be so lucky as to score a mate with his intellect.\n\n\n\nCon artists don’t sell reality; they sell an illusion that their victims already want to believe. Most of us go through our lives in thrall to optimistic illusions. We think of ourselves as being a bit better, smarter, more attractive, and more important than we actually are—and we remain convinced that tomorrow will be better than today. As Shelley Taylor, a psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, put it, people generally believe that “the present is better than the past and that the future will be even better.” It’s how we get through life. Taylor explained that “in effect, most people seem to be saying, ‘The future will be great, especially for me.’ ”\n\n\n\nInasmuch as con artists are peddlers of hope who tell us what we want to hear, many politicians have taken a page from the grifter’s playbook. Still, there’s a difference between ordinary political flattery and political grifting. Again, the dividing line is that of intentionality. Does a politician believe, to some extent, in his promises—or are they incidental to an ultimate goal, which, in the case of the political confidence man, will have nothing whatsoever to do with politics? It’s not a case of misrepresenting one’s policies but of not actually having a policy. And, indeed, Trump’s promises are often deliberately vague. He meets demands for specifics with another tool from the con artist’s arsenal: emotion. People who are emotional are not logical. Appeal to them on the emotional level and you no longer need coherent arguments. Here, as ever, there’s a thin line between ordinary politics and political grifting. Trump the politician might use emotion to inspire. But Trump the con artist would knowingly use emotion to deceive and mislead, caring little about the words or the substance as long as he gets what he wants.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWe can never get into Trump’s head. We don’t know what his intentions are. It’s possible that he does have political convictions. In the meantime, though, the best evidence for Trump’s potential con artistry comes from the lawsuits against his defunct for-profit educational venture, Trump University. Last week, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that a lawsuit that had been brought against Trump University in 2013 could go forward. That suit accuses Trump of actual fraud, or, as the [decision](http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2016/2016_01430.htm) puts it, of the use of “deception, misrepresentation, concealment, suppression, false pretense, false promise or unconscionable contractual provisions” to “defraud.” If, in the end, the ruling goes against Trump, we will be able to say, definitively, that he is a con artist—that he deliberately engaged in deception, using a wholly incidental platform to attain ends of money and influence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, to counter disgruntled students’ claims, Trump set up a Web site—98percentapproval.com—that touted the high ratings that Trump University courses had received. How could the school be a fraud if students were happy? A California judge, Kim Wardlaw, addressed this issue in her [ruling](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1628150.html) in another lawsuit against Trump University. “As the recent Ponzi-scheme scandals involving onetime financial luminaries like Bernard Madoff and Allen Stanford demonstrate, victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until the moment they realize they have been fleeced,” she wrote. Wardlaw is right about marks. Not only do they sing the grifter’s praises until the moment they’ve been fleeced but they often keep singing them afterward, so as to not admit to themselves, or the rest of us, that any fleecing has taken place.\n\n\n\nThis raises a depressing possibility. If Trump is indeed a con artist, and if he is, in the end, elected, we may end up not wanting to admit that we were scammed. At the moment, Trump’s supporters see him as authentic and honest, even as they dismiss more traditional candidates, like Hillary Clinton, as quintessential politicians—that is, as opportunistic liars. Perhaps, in the future, we’ll cling to this belief to preserve our collective self-image. In that case, the term “con artist” may end up applying to us, too.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/donald-trump-con-artist","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016

(In some head-to-head polls matching a Democrat against Trump, Sanders does better than Clinton.) Nonetheless, it’s an interesting argument. And, in principle, it could help to explain why Clinton did better in Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio than she did in Michigan last week.\n\n\n\nIs there any evidence in the exit polls to support the “Trump scare” theory? Only in Missouri, which Clinton won by fewer than two thousand voters (pending a possible recount). Among Democrats who made up their minds more than a few days before they cast their votes—a group that included four-fifths of the electorate—Sanders got a small majority: fifty per cent to forty-nine per cent, [according to CNN’s exit poll](http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/mo/Dem). If he had maintained this margin among the late deciders, he would have won the primary. But the fifth of the electorate that made up its mind in the final few days broke slightly for Clinton; she got fifty per cent of their votes, compared to Sanders’s forty-seven per cent. That three-point margin was enough to carry Clinton to victory, 49.6 per cent to 49.4 per cent.\n\n\n\nBut in Illinois and Ohio, according to the figures from the CNN exit polls in those states, most of the late deciders voted for Sanders. In [Illinois](http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/il/Dem), another tight race, which Clinton won with 50.4 per cent of the vote to Sanders’s 48.7 per cent, about one in five voters made up his mind in the last few days before the vote. Among this group, Clinton got forty-seven per cent of the vote, and Sanders got fifty-three. In [Ohio](http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/oh/Dem), which Clinton won by fifty-seven per cent to forty-three percent, it was a similar story. The voters who made up their minds in the final few days, about a fifth of the electorate, went for Sanders by fifty-one per cent to forty-eight per cent. Among voters who decided earlier, Clinton won by fifty-seven per cent to forty-two per cent.\n\n\n\nOf course, these figures aren't definitive. It is possible that, if there hadn't been any violence last weekend, the late deciders in the Midwest would have skewed more heavily toward Sanders. But that seems unlikely, and it is, therefore, unfair to Clinton to suggest that heightened fear of Trump was the decisive factor on Tuesday. Other factors need to be considered. All across the map, Clinton demonstrated areas of strength, which have now carried her to a substantial lead over Sanders in both [the delegate count](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/democratic_delegate_count.html) and [the popular vote](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/democratic_vote_count.html).\n\n\n\nIn all five states that she won, she again finished way ahead among minority voters. In [Florida](http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/fl/Dem), for example, eighty-one per cent of black voters chose her, as did sixty-eight per cent of Hispanic voters. In Illinois, she got sixty-three per cent of the nonwhite vote; in Ohio, she got sixty-seven per cent. She also racked up big wins among Democrats aged forty-five or older, who make up the majority of the electorate. In Ohio, for example, she won seventy per cent of the vote in the older demographics; in Missouri, it was sixty-two per cent.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, Clinton struggled again among younger voters. In Missouri, fewer than one in three voters aged seventeen to forty-four voted for her. Even in [North Carolina](http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/nc/Dem), which she carried by fourteen percentage points, she received only forty per cent of the younger vote. But in some places she did better than she has been doing among white voters. In [Florida](http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/fl/Dem), for example, she carried that voter segment by eight percentage points, and in [Ohio](http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/oh/Dem) she carried it by six percentage points.\n\n\n\nThe win in the Buckeye State, which, like Michigan, has lost a lot of manufacturing jobs, was particularly gratifying for the Clinton campaign. Not only did she finish ahead of Sanders in every income group and educational cohort, she kept his lead among white men down to three percentage points, fifty-one to forty-eight. And she even bested him by nine points among voters who believe that trade with other countries costs the United States jobs.\n\n\n\nHow did she do it? In a [memo](http://bluevirginia.us/2016/03/memo-hillarys-commanding-lead-primary) that he released to reporters on Wednesday, Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, credited her campaigning skills, saying Ohio voters “overwhelmingly rewarded her for her commitment to defend American workers in trade deals and for being the only candidate with a clear plan to revitalize manufacturing in the country.”\n\n\n\nThere might be something to this argument. But the result in Ohio—and, to some extent, her wins in the other Midwestern states—was also a victory for history and organization. In 2008, Clinton defeated Barack Obama by nine points in Ohio. This time around, her campaign invested a lot of time and energy in repeating that victory, and it has received a great deal of support from the state’s big public-sector unions—particularly the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the Service Employees International Union; and the teachers’ unions—which, over the past few years, have been battling Governor John Kasich’s anti-union reforms.\n\n\n\n“AFSCME members in yesterday’s primary states joined with other working families to knock on tens of thousands of doors,” Lee Saunders, the president of the A.F.S.C.M.E., [said](http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/16/union-boss-praises-hillary-for-sweeping-victories-over-bernie/) on Wednesday. With the state’s union canvassers particularly energized and active, it could be argued that Kasich did as much as Trump did to insure Clinton’s victory.\n\n\n\nTo sum up, then, there might be something to the “Trump scare” theory, but it is only the part of the story. Clinton, despite the baggage that she carries and the problems she sometimes has articulating a message, retains a broad base of support in the Democratic Party and its affiliated organizations. On Tuesday, that was enough to move her closer to clinching the nomination.\n\n\n\n_*An earlier version of this post misstated one of the states that Clinton won on Tuesday._","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-hillary-clinton-triumphed-on-tuesday","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c8aee7fe02cbd16334d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hillary Clinton","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hillary-clinton"},{"id":"5c2e2078b75f002c8941e77e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"primary","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"primary"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f15a2179605b11ad1ec0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"John Cassidy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"john-cassidy"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

Trump’s ascent to the top of the Republican field was initially amusing, then confounding, and has now reached its full flourish as a frightening window into the American present. Trump has not simply emerged suddenly as a representative of populist white anger—the G.O.P. has been tilling those fields for decades—he has stripped the old structure down to the studs and, in its place, offered a garish new architecture, a populism unrestrained by convention or code words. It is honest, or at least frank, in its intent. As [Jill Lepore pointed out](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/did-social-media-produce-the-new-populism) in _The New Yorker_, the lines between the crowds drawn to Bernie Sanders and those drawn to Donald Trump tend to blur, each defining themselves against establishment candidates whose positions were cemented by their familial ties to Presidencies past. Those lines became a bit more distinct last week after a multiracial group of protesters disrupted a scheduled Trump rally in Chicago. Believing the unrest was the work of the Sanders’s campaign, Trump tweeted, “Bernie is lying when he says disruptors aren’t told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!” But, in a real sense, we are seeing in the Trump and Sanders phenomena not only the expression of frustrations in which the electorate has been steeped during the Obama years but also the clearest statement of the problems of populism since its inception.\n\n\n\nThe default presumption about populism holds that its appeal peaks in times of economic crisis, and this is partly true, as suggested by the populist upsurge of the eighteen-nineties, when disgruntled farmers transformed their anger at banks seizing their land into the populist People’s Party, and the insurgent campaign of Ross Perot, a century later. But, in America, populism is driven not solely by distress at economic malaise but also by fears inspired by racial progress—and the belief that these two things are synonymous. This is the reason the Tea Party took hold not amid the economic collapse that occurred during George W. Bush’s tenure but in the midst of Barack Obama’s Presidency, its anger siphoned into conspiracy theories about the President’s Kenyan origins rather than Wall Street cronyism. The populism of the eighteen-nineties flirted with racial liberalism, organizing impoverished black farmers as well as white ones before being consumed by such Negrophobic zeal that Tom Watson, its chief proponent, was implicated in the mass lynching of African-Americans during the 1906 Atlanta race riot. Bigotry has generally been part of the lingua franca of American populism, if in varying degrees, since that point.\n\n\n\nSixty-eight years ago, the public watched a dynamic similar to the Trump-Sanders moment play out as Harry Truman sought the Presidency, an office he had held since Franklin Roosevelt’s death, in 1945. Truman was pitted against the Republican Thomas Dewey but faced additional challenges from Henry Wallace, whom he had replaced as F.D.R.’s Vice-President, in 1941, and Strom Thurmond, the populist segregationist and South Carolina governor. Both Wallace and Thurmond purported to speak for the common man whose interests had been compromised by the Democratic Party, yet this presumption led them to strikingly different places. Wallace’s Progressive Party campaign denounced big banks, countenanced the support of socialists and communists, and, notably, advocated equal rights for African-Americans and an end to segregation. When the Democratic Party—motivated in part by Wallace’s left-flank candidacy and partly by the Great Migration, which had delivered millions of Republican-leaning African-Americans to Democratic strongholds in the North—adopted a strong civil-rights plank at its convention, Southern segregationists bolted and formed the States’ Rights (Dixiecrat) Party.\n\n\n\nIn his speech protesting the civil-rights plank, Thurmond stated, “We do not intend that our constitutional rights shall be sacrificed for the selfish and sordid purpose of gaining minority votes.” It’s worth noting that the 1948 Dixiecrat platform called for two things: segregation of the races and “social and economic justice.” This was not accidental—in the logic of Southern populism, the former was a prerequisite for the latter. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s frequent conflicts with the Southern wing of his party hinged not on the creation of a welfare state but on segregationist demands that only one race be the beneficiary of it.\n\n\n\nFaced with the reality of its limited geographic appeal, the Dixiecrat Party sought to leverage its authority by denying both Truman and Dewey a majority in the electoral college, thereby throwing the election in the House of Representatives, where the Dixiecrats could broker a tie-breaking alliance in return for the abandonment of civil-rights enforcement. Instead, Truman won three hundred and three electoral votes, far more than the hundred and eighty-nine captured by the Republican, Thomas Dewey. Still, Wallace and Thurmond each won about a 1.2 million votes, and while Wallace did not win any single state Thurmond won Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina—all states, coincidentally, that Donald Trump has won in this year’s primaries.\n\n\n\nTrump is not drawing upon an entirely hallucinatory anxiety—many of the [concerns](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/despair-american-style.html) of his voters are real. The difference between Bernie Sanders’s version of populism and Trump’s is simply where you lay the blame for this state of affairs. Bill Clinton once said of Ross Perot that you “can’t be a billionaire populist,” and that objection would seem equally applicable to Trump, a man who made his millions building housing for the monied classes, and casinos and golf courses where they could gamble that money away and then cut deals to make more. But Clinton was relying on an outmoded idea of populism. Trump’s is not a populism of economics or even religion, as his success with Christian voters, despite his scriptural ineptitude, demonstrates. It is, rather, a populism of identity. In this regard, his wealth doesn’t contradict his ability to function as a populist symbol; it’s exactly the point.  Here is a billionaire validating the fears of economically vulnerable white people. Who better than a symbol of wealth to explain how the pathway to similar attainment has been blocked, and who is responsible for it?  Trump is not religious, but that has not disqualified him from being an evangelist of his own sort.\n\n\n\nLast summer, large numbers of Sanders supporters took offense at the serial disruption of his campaign events by Black Lives Matter protesters. In retrospect, they appear to have done Sanders a favor. To the extent that his brand of populism is viable, it is dependent on the kind of cross-racial appeal to common economic despair that Henry Wallace understood nearly seventy years ago. In forcing his campaign to court African-Americans earlier and more aggressively than it otherwise would have, Black Lives Matter facilitated Sanders’s upset of Clinton in Michigan—a state where he garnered nearly a third of black votes. The civil-rights movement in which Sanders was a proud participant was itself a response to the identity populism of Southern whites.\n\n\n\nGeorge Wallace—no relation to Henry—another other Southern populist to whom Trump draws frequent comparisons, blamed his own (relative) racial leniency for his loss in Alabama’s 1958 Democratic gubernatorial primary and reportedly told an aide that he would “never be outniggered again.” He was elected four years later, on a platform of segregation. This is not the United States of 1948 or 1958. The country is both larger and more diverse. It has been transformed by successive movements for a more inclusive society, even if, a black Presidency notwithstanding, political power remains overwhelmingly in the hands of whites. This diversity is commonly heralded as a sign of progress, but it’s also the reason a New York-born one-per-center can appeal to Southern whites in such tremendous numbers. Trump’s brand of populism is cemented in the ideal that he will not be out-Muslimed, out-Latinoed, or out-baited regarding any other signpost of American change. And it’s selling. They are all Dixiecrats now.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-a-frightening-window-into-the-american-present","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7736cecf40192141c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Presidential Candidates","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"presidential-candidates"},{"id":"5c2e1c7bb75f002c8941e471","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Racism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"racism"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c957a4e65be2f29d55262","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jelani Cobb has been contributing to _The New Yorker_ since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.
